# CVF W114-T1 CP8 Public Evidence Packet Assessment

> Date: 2026-04-23
> Status: PASS / COMPLETE
> Memory class: FULL_RECORD
> Roadmap: `docs/roadmaps/CVF_W114_T1_NONCODER_VALUE_MAXIMIZATION_AND_EVIDENCE_ROADMAP_2026-04-22.md`
> Checkpoint: CP8

## 1. Verdict

W114-CP8 is complete. The public evidence packet is published and the W114 exit criteria are satisfied with explicit live-vs-workspace evidence boundaries.

## 2. Deliverables

| Deliverable | Path | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public evidence packet | `docs/reference/CVF_W114_PUBLIC_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-23.md` | PUBLISHED |
| README current status update | `README.md` — status table, commentary, workspace bootstrap section | UPDATED |
| ARCHITECTURE evidence posture update | `ARCHITECTURE.md` — evidence table, non-coder value section | UPDATED |

## 3. Public Packet Structure

The public evidence packet (`CVF_W114_PUBLIC_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-23.md`) contains:

- **Plain-language summary** of what CVF does for a non-coder (7 concrete behaviours)
- **Evidence summary table** — 13 claims each with evidence reference, status, and live/workspace boundary
- **Plain-language product wording** — what CVF helps a non-coder do in one paragraph
- **Evidence chain** — pointers to each CP assessment, raw JSON, and implementation files
- **Claim boundaries** — 6 explicit boundary statements bounding multi-provider, Web runtime, workspace doctor, sample count, and mock
- **Known limitations** — 5 explicit limitations the packet does not claim
- **How To Verify** — reproducible commands for live governance, workspace enforcement, multi-sample downstream proof, and workspace-to-web bridge receipts

## 4. README Changes

Added or updated:

- Current Status table row: `Downstream adoption proof` now reflects W114-CP7 (3 tested samples, not universal downstream compatibility)
- Commentary: added CP7 and CP8 summary lines
- Public claim wording: separates live API-backed Web governance/outcome claims from workspace/downstream artifact, doctor, test, and bridge claims
- Workspace Bootstrap section: downstream proof line now references both W113 and W114-CP7

## 5. ARCHITECTURE Changes

Updated:

- Evidence posture table row `Downstream adoption proof`: W114-CP7 3 tested kinds, all 11/11 PASS, with live-evidence bridge boundary
- Evidence posture table row `Non-coder value optimization`: CP1-CP8 COMPLETE
- Non-Coder Value subsection: added CP7 multi-sample and CP8 public packet confirmation; removed "expand downstream proof beyond one sample" as an open item

## 6. Exit Criteria Check

| W114 exit criterion | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Non-coder scorecard refreshed and evidence-linked | CP1 COMPLETE — `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_NONCODER_VALUE_SCORECARD_2026-04-23.md` |
| Workspace live readiness clearly separated from enforcement | CP2 COMPLETE — `-CheckLiveReadiness` mode added |
| W113 web metadata proof release-gated or bounded | CP3 COMPLETE — promoted into default live release gate; live governance `8 passed` |
| Compact live non-coder outcome evidence pack exists | CP4 COMPLETE — `19/19` route decisions, `12/12` useful outputs |
| Web visibly communicates CVF value in main non-coder flow | CP5 COMPLETE — `ProcessingScreen` governance evidence panel live |
| Downstream evidence expanded beyond one sample or boundary retained | CP7 COMPLETE — 3 tested samples across 3 project kinds |
| Public docs say ≤ what evidence proves | CP8 COMPLETE — public packet distinguishes live Web governance proof from workspace/downstream proof |

**All 7 W114 exit criteria: SATISFIED.**

## 7. Boundary

The public evidence packet is bounded to:

- Alibaba `qwen-turbo` as the primary proven governance lane
- DeepSeek `deepseek-chat` for multi-provider operability (not independent value proof)
- Web active governed AI path (not full CVF runtime)
- 3 tested downstream samples (not universal downstream compatibility)
- Vitest + mock Playwright as UI-structure-only evidence

Release-quality governance proof remains:

```bash
python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json
```
