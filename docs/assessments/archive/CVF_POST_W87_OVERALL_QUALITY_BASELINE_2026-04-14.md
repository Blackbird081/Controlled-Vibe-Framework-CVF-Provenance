Memory class: POINTER_RECORD
> Purpose: establish the authoritative post-W87 baseline for future agents
> Scope: CVF after W71–W87, including knowledge-native closure, PVV resume, and HIGH_RISK guided-response closure
> Canon anchor date: 2026-04-14

## 1. Executive Verdict

CVF is now stronger in a way that matters more directly to non-coder usage than it was at W85.

Why:

- the absorbed-knowledge lane is still globally closure-clean
- the governed runtime path was exercised through W86
- the specific HIGH_RISK non-coder guidance gap identified in W86 was closed in W87

This means CVF has moved from:

- “knowledge-native and internally disciplined”

to:

- “knowledge-native, runtime-tested, and beginning to close non-coder safety/help gaps on the actual governed execution path”

### Overall verdict

| Dimension | Verdict | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture / governance quality | **HIGH** | Knowledge-native lane remains one of the cleanest governed absorption efforts in the repo |
| Runtime/provider evidence quality | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | W86 added live governed-path evidence; still not full provider-hub proof |
| Non-coder safety/helpfulness on governed path | **IMPROVED** | W87 closes the API-layer guidance gap for 3 concrete HIGH_RISK patterns |
| Front-door non-coder UX realization | **PARTIAL** | Backend/API capability is ahead of UI consumption |
| Recommended next priority | **UI consumption of guided responses on the 1-provider path** | Multi-provider expansion is temporarily deferred |

Updated rating:

- **8.9 / 10** architecture-governance quality
- **8.5 / 10** readiness to create visible non-coder value

## 2. What W86 and W87 Changed

### 2.1 W86

W86 proved something the knowledge-native lane by itself could not prove:

- the governed `/api/execute` path can be evaluated against direct API behavior
- NORMAL non-coder tasks achieved parity
- HIGH_RISK tasks exposed a concrete help gap rather than a hidden failure

This was valuable because it converted a vague concern into a bounded product truth.

### 2.2 W87

W87 then closed that gap for three concrete HIGH_RISK patterns:

- `NC_003_PASSWORD_STORAGE`
- `NC_006_CODE_ATTRIBUTION`
- `NC_007_API_KEY_FRONTEND`

The important improvement is not that CVF became “more permissive”.
It became **more helpful while staying governed**:

- `BLOCK` and `NEEDS_APPROVAL` remain in force
- but now the governed path can offer safe-path alternatives instead of only halting

That is exactly the right direction for non-coder value.

---

## 3. Quality Assessment After W87

### 3.1 What is now genuinely better

CVF now does three things better than before:

1. It can detect unsafe/non-compliant high-risk non-coder prompts.
2. It can keep governance posture intact.
3. It can return bounded next-step guidance for at least three important failure classes.

This is a meaningful product improvement, not just internal refactoring.

### 3.2 What is still not fully solved

The main unresolved question is now narrower:

> Is the new guided response value actually reaching the non-coder in the front-door UI flow?

Repo scan at this baseline shows:

- `guidedResponse` exists in `src/app/api/execute/route.ts`
- pattern logic exists in `src/app/api/execute/guided.response.registry.ts`
- tests cover the registry and route behavior

But the same scan does **not** show a clear consumer of `guidedResponse` in the main UI/chat layer.

That means the capability is present at API layer, but the user-facing realization may still be incomplete.

---

## 4. Non-Coder Web Verdict After W87

### Short answer

**The web is meaningfully better for non-coders after W87, but the improvement is still stronger in governed backend behavior than in visible front-end guidance delivery.**

### What is now strong

- governed external-asset flows
- knowledge governance operator flows
- non-coder language helpers
- governed runtime parity on NORMAL tasks
- safe fallback guidance for 3 HIGH_RISK patterns at API layer

### What still needs proof or realization

- whether the main chat / front-door workflow actually shows the new `guidedResponse` payload clearly
- whether non-coders perceive the governed path as more helpful, not just more restrictive
- whether the improvement scales beyond the 3 W87 patterns

### Honest product verdict

At W85, the right statement was:

> the web has inherited important upgrades, but the main non-coder vibe-coding loop has not fully harvested them yet

At W87, the stronger statement is:

> the main governed execution path is now closer to the non-coder promise, because it can guide instead of only block for key HIGH_RISK cases, but the UI-level harvesting of that value is still not fully confirmed

---

## 5. What Must Not Be Reopened

Future agents should still treat these as closed:

- Graphify / LLM-Powered / Palace absorption arbitration
- completion-matrix debate
- N1/N2/N3/N4 closure logic
- W84 benchmark interpretation
- W85 canon-sync logic
- W86 finding that the HIGH_RISK gap existed
- W87 finding that the 3-pattern API-layer gap is now closed

The next work should build on these truths, not re-litigate them.

---

## 6. Recommended Next Directions

There is still **no default active tranche** after W87.

But candidate directions are no longer equal.

### Priority A — if the goal is immediate non-coder product value

Open a fresh tranche to ensure the W87 `guidedResponse` capability is **actually consumed by the main non-coder UI flow**.

This is the best next move if the operator goal is:

- make the web feel more helpful right now
- ensure non-coders actually see the safe-path alternatives
- convert backend governed help into visible product help

### Priority B — temporarily deferred

Broader multi-provider PVV expansion is **not** the current priority.

Reason:

- if CVF cannot yet deliver its full core value to non-coders through one stable provider path, then multi-provider work is still secondary
- if CVF **can** deliver its full core value through one stable provider path, then later multi-provider work becomes mainly a portability / robustness / engineering expansion

So the current strategic rule is:

**prove the non-coder product value through one provider first; suspend broader multi-provider expansion until that is visibly true in the front-door product experience.**

### Priority C — if the goal is bounded safety coverage expansion

Extend guided responses to additional HIGH_RISK patterns, but only after:

- confirming whether current UI surfaces actually render the W87 value
- or collecting evidence that other HIGH_RISK patterns are now the dominant gap

---

## 7. Baseline Decision For Future Agents

Until superseded, future agents should assume:

1. CVF knowledge-native absorption is settled and strong.
2. W86 gave runtime evidence on the governed execution path.
3. W87 improved non-coder help at API layer for 3 concrete HIGH_RISK patterns.
4. The next product-value question is no longer “can CVF detect unsafe requests?” but “is the governed guidance reaching users in the front-door UI?”
5. The most important remaining gap for non-coder value is **UI realization of governed help on the current 1-provider path**, not backend doctrine.
6. Multi-provider PVV expansion is temporarily deferred until the 1-provider non-coder value loop is clearly realized.

---

## 8. Final Baseline Statement

**Post-W87 baseline statement:**  
CVF is no longer just internally well-governed and knowledge-native. It now shows real progress toward the non-coder promise on the governed execution path. The immediate priority is to make that governed help fully visible and felt in the front-door product experience through the current stable provider path. Multi-provider expansion is intentionally secondary until that core value is clearly realized.
