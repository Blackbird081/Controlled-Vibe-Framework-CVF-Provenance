# CVF W85-T1 Post-W84 Canon Sync Assessment

Memory class: FULL_RECORD
> Class: DOCUMENTATION / CANON_SYNC
> Tranche: W85-T1 Post-W84 Canon Truth Sync
> Date: 2026-04-14
> Status: PRE-SYNC ASSESSMENT — FILED BEFORE CHANGES

## 1. Purpose

This document establishes the exact canon mismatch to be corrected by W85-T1. It is the entry-gate assessment for the tranche, required by the W85-T1 roadmap before any file edits are made.

This is a **correction wave**, not a capability wave, not a reassessment wave, and not a benchmark rerun.

---

## 2. Mismatch Summary

At the time of filing, repo state contains a narrow canon gap:

| Surface | Expected (W84 truth) | Actual (stale W83 truth) | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` line 297 | `Last canonical closure = W84-T1` | `Last canonical closure = W83-T1` | Behind by 1 tranche |
| `CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` line 298 | No active tranche after W84 | `NONE — W83-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED 2026-04-14` | Stale label |
| `CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` line 8 | `latest governed closure W84-T1` | `latest governed closure W83-T1` | Behind by 1 tranche |
| `CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` line 23 | No active tranche after W84 | `NONE — W83-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED 2026-04-14` | Stale label |
| `CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` tranche table | W84-T1 row present | No W84-T1 row after W83-T1 row | Missing row |

## 3. Files That Are Ahead (Source Truth)

These files correctly record the W84-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED state:

- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_GC018_W84_T1_KNOWLEDGE_LIVE_BENCHMARK_EVIDENCE_PROMOTION_AUTHORIZATION_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_W84_T1_BENCHMARK_RUN_MANIFEST_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_W84_T1_KNOWLEDGE_LIVE_BENCHMARK_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/assessments/CVF_W84_T1_POST_RUN_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_GC026_TRACKER_SYNC_W84_T1_CLOSED_2026-04-14.md`
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` (updated with W84-T1 entry and reviewer correction noting the pending sync)

## 4. Files That Are Behind (Sync Targets)

These files must be updated by W85-T1:

- `docs/reference/CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` — `Last canonical closure`, `Current active tranche`, `Current posture`
- `docs/reference/CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` — `Last refreshed`, `Current active tranche`, tranche table (add W84-T1 row and W85-T1 row)
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — replace temporary reviewer-correction posture with W85-T1 final closure wording

---

## 5. What W84-T1 Decided (Preserved Unchanged)

W85-T1 must not alter any of the following:

- Decision: **HYBRID / NO SINGLE DEFAULT CONFIRMED**
- Evidence class upgrade: `PROPOSAL_ONLY` (W78-T1) → `LIVE_INFERENCE` (W84-T1)
- Benchmark results: compiled avg 0.667, raw avg 0.556, Δ +0.111; temporal consistency delta 0.00 on all 3 scenarios
- No policy change. No canon change to N3 decision.
- No new architecture surface.
- No code changes.

These are facts from the W84 evidence packet. W85-T1 only propagates them to the front-door surfaces.

---

## 6. Classification

This tranche is classified as:

- **DOCUMENTATION / CANON_SYNC**
- Not a new capability wave
- Not a new evidence generation
- Not a benchmark rerun
- Not a reassessment of N1/N2/N3/N4 gates

---

## 7. Expected End State After W85-T1

- `CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` → `Last canonical closure = W84-T1`
- `CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` → `Last refreshed = W84-T1`; W84-T1 and W85-T1 rows in tranche table
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` → reviewer-correction posture replaced with final closure; W85-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED recorded
- Knowledge-native lane W71–W84 may then be called **fully closure-clean** across all front-door canon surfaces
