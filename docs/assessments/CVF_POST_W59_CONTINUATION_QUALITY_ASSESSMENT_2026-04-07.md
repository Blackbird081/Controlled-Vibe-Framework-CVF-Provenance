# CVF Post-W59 Continuation Quality Assessment

Memory class: SUMMARY_RECORD

> Date: 2026-04-07
> Assessed by: Cascade (agent)
> Baseline tranches: W55-T1 (MC1) + W56-T1 (MC2) + W57-T1 (MC3) + W58-T1 (MC4) + W59-T1 (MC5)
> Status: MC SEQUENCE FULLY COMPLETE — no defined next MC step

## MC Sequence Completion State

The MC1-MC5 canonical closure sequence is fully complete as of W59-T1 CP1 (2026-04-07).

| MC | Plane | Tranche | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| MC1 | CPF | W55-T1 | DONE-ready |
| MC2 | GEF | W56-T1 | DONE (6/6) |
| MC3 | LPF | W57-T1 | DONE-ready (7/7) |
| MC4 | EPF | W58-T1 | DONE-ready |
| MC5 | Whitepaper | W59-T1 | COMPLETE |

---

## Post-MC5 Posture

The whitepaper is now the authoritative closure truth source. No SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED labels
remain for any plane banner or component box (except intentional DEFERRED items and CLOSED-BY-DEFAULT
deferrals). Test counts are unchanged: CPF 2929 / EPF 1301 / GEF 625 / LPF 1465.

## Future Work Categories

Any future continuation requires a fresh bounded `GC-018`. No continuation is pre-authorized by
this assessment. Categories that may warrant future tranches:

| Category | Condition for opening |
|---|---|
| Fresh EPF capability wave | Model Gateway provider routing or Sandbox Runtime isolation authorized — requires `CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB` readiness + fresh GC-018 |
| CPF relocation / consolidation | Preservation override + fresh GC-019 + GC-039 + dedicated branch |
| npm publish | Human-gated action — see `docs/audits/archive/CVF_P4_CP16_PACKAGING_ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_AUDIT_2026-04-03.md` |
| CI/CD coverage expansion | Fresh GC-018 scoped to CI coverage gap |
| Web UI type-drift remediation | Fresh GC-018 scoped to `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web` |
| Whitepaper v3.8 promotion | Only when a new realization wave closes new architecture targets |

No tranche should be opened without re-reading AGENT_HANDOFF.md and CVF_SURFACE_SCAN_REGISTRY.json first.
