## 1. Purpose

This note answers the canonical reassessment question after the full Graphify / LLM-Powered / Palace knowledge-native lane reached absorption, closure, and value realization (W71–W82):

1. What new capability is now officially part of baseline CVF?
2. What remains optional product adoption rather than canon core?
3. How should the master architecture now describe the Knowledge Layer?
4. Whether the architecture snapshot / closure summary / tracker rows still reflect reality?

---

## 2. Pre-Uplift State (before W71-T1)

Before the knowledge-native absorption wave, the CVF Knowledge Layer consisted of:

- `KnowledgeQueryContract` — keyword/context-based item retrieval
- `KnowledgeRankingContract` + batch — relevance-scored ranking of retrieved items
- `KnowledgeQueryBatchContract` — batch aggregation of query results
- `RagContextEngineConvergenceContract` — declarative RAG retrieval authority and packaging API (W9-T1)

The Knowledge Layer had **no lifecycle governance** — there was no compile step, no governance gate, no maintenance loop, no refactor recommendation surface, and no structural graph traversal.

The only architectural claim around "knowledge governance" was the declarative `defaultPolicyStatus = NOT_DECIDED` on the RAG convergence contract — meaning CVF explicitly deferred the question of which retrieval mode should be the canonical default.

Whitepaper posture at this point: `CLOSURE-ASSESSED` — all four planes done-ready, but Knowledge Layer described only at retrieval/ranking scope.

---

## 3. Post-Uplift State (after W82-T1)

After the wave W71–W82, the Knowledge Layer is qualitatively different:

### 3.1 Full 6-step lifecycle at CPF contract layer

| Step | Contract | Wave |
|------|----------|------|
| 1. Ingest / W7 | `W7MemoryRecordContract` | W73-T1 |
| 2. Compile | `CompiledKnowledgeArtifactContract.compile()` | W72-T4 |
| 3. Govern | `CompiledKnowledgeArtifactContract.govern()` | W72-T4 |
| 4. Query | `KnowledgeQueryContract`, `KnowledgeRankingContract`, `StructuralIndexContract` | pre-W72 + W72-T1 |
| 5. Maintain | `KnowledgeMaintenanceContract` (5 check types) | W73-T2 |
| 6. Refactor | `KnowledgeRefactorContract` (3 action heuristics) | W74-T1 |

### 3.2 Structural enrichment path

`StructuralIndexContract` (W72-T1) added a governed BFS-based graph traversal for knowledge entities, operating as a **peer mode** alongside text-based retrieval — not as a replacement or unconditional default.

### 3.3 Consumer-facing output surface

`KnowledgeContextAssemblyContract` (W75-T1) and `KnowledgeContextAssemblyConsumerPipelineContract` (W76-T1) gave the Knowledge Layer a complete consumer-facing output path that chains ranking → context assembly (with structural enrichment) → consumer package in a single governed `execute()` call.

### 3.4 Canon retrieval authority declared (N1)

`declareKnowledgeNativeRetrievalAuthority()` (W77-T1) registered 40 FIXED_INPUT surfaces and 3 IN_SCOPE declarations, formally closing the open question from W9-T1 about which surface held the top-level retrieval authority. The answer: **knowledge-native consumer pipeline bridge is the top-level canon authority post-W77.**

### 3.5 Benchmark evidence class defined (N2)

W78-T1 defined `contract-layer evidence closure`: `PROPOSAL_ONLY` evidence + formal gate assessment + GC-026 trace = valid closure for a contract-layer system. The benchmark evidence gate was NOT FULLY MET at contract layer (no live inference system), leading to the **HYBRID / NO SINGLE DEFAULT** decision.

### 3.6 N2 decision promoted to canon (N3)

W79-T1 embedded the HYBRID / NO SINGLE DEFAULT decision into three canonical docs: the compiled context governance policy, the whitepaper §4.3, and the progress tracker. CVF-native core 100% gate declared CLOSED.

### 3.7 Operator/product surface (N4)

W80-T1 added 3 knowledge API routes to cvf-web (`/api/governance/knowledge/compile`, `/maintain`, `/refactor`). W81-T1 applied canon-closure corrections (N1 dual authority + N2/N3 evidence-gate). W82-T1 added the `/governance/knowledge` operator UI page with 3-step workflow, 7-scenario E2E tests, operator guide, and value evidence packet. The `evidenceClass` gate is CLOSED per the contract-layer closure standard.

## 4. Concrete Value Gained

| Dimension | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Knowledge lifecycle | retrieval + ranking only | full 6-step governed lifecycle |
| Structural enrichment | none | BFS structural index, peer mode to text retrieval |
| Context output | ranking result only | assembled context packets with structural neighbor attachment |
| Canon retrieval authority | open/NOT_DECIDED | declared: knowledge-native consumer pipeline is top-level authority |
| Retrieval default policy | deferred | HYBRID / NO SINGLE DEFAULT (compiled-preferred conditional + raw-source fallback) |
| Operator surface | none | 3 API routes + `/governance/knowledge` UI page |
| Evidence closure standard | undefined for contract-layer systems | defined (PROPOSAL_ONLY + gate assessment + GC-026) |

---

## 5. Architectural Implications

### 5.1 Knowledge Layer is now a first-class governed lifecycle

The Knowledge Layer is no longer just a query/ranking sidecar to the Control Plane. It now has its own:
- lifecycle (6 steps, all CPF-contracted)
- governance gate (approved/pending/rejected artifact states)
- maintenance loop (5 signal types detecting drift, orphans, staleness, lint, contradiction)
- refactor recommendation path (3 action heuristics)

This means future work touching knowledge should treat the Knowledge Layer as an independent governed domain, not as a utility bag of retrieval helpers.

### 5.2 Structural index is peer, not replacement

The `StructuralIndexContract` BFS traversal is a **peer mode** — it supplements text retrieval at query time when structural context is available. It does NOT replace `KnowledgeRankingContract` and does NOT unconditionally default to graph-first. This is an architectural invariant, not a provisional posture.

### 5.3 No Palace runtime, no Graph Memory Layer

The knowledge-native wave deliberately excluded:
- Graph Memory Layer (runtime-complex, no evidence)
- Persistent Wiki surface (operator scope, no evidence)
- MemPalace Runtime (no runtime exists yet)
- G-GM-* guard family (no guard trigger)
- CLI command families (no CLI runtime)

These remain REJECTED / DEFERRED BY DESIGN. This decision is now architecture canon, not a deferred question.

### 5.4 Consumer pipeline bridge is the canonical integration pattern

The `KnowledgeContextAssemblyConsumerPipelineContract` establishes that all caller-facing Knowledge Layer use should go through the consumer pipeline bridge. Direct use of `KnowledgeRankingContract` alone does not carry structural enrichment or context window estimation into the consumer package.

---

## 6. What Is Canon Core vs Optional Product Adoption

### Canon core (part of CVF baseline — not optional)

- All CPF Knowledge Layer contracts: W72-T1 through W76-T1 (StructuralIndex, CompiledArtifact, MemoryRecord, Maintenance, Refactor, ContextAssembly, ConsumerPipeline + all batch variants)
- Canon retrieval authority declaration: W77-T1
- HYBRID / NO SINGLE DEFAULT policy: W78-T1 + W79-T1
- 6-step lifecycle doctrine: W72-T2
- Benchmark criteria + evidence class standard: W72-T3, W78-T1
- Palace vocabulary enrichment fields: W72-T6 (enrichment-only, no runtime)

### Optional product adoption (layered on top — not required for core compliance)

- Knowledge API routes in cvf-web: W80-T1
- `/governance/knowledge` operator UI: W82-T1
- Value evidence packet scenarios: W82-T1
- Knowledge Governance Operator Guide: W82-T1

## 7. Architecture Snapshot / Tracker Truth After This Reassessment

Before W83-T1, the master architecture whitepaper and progress tracker stopped at W79-T1. After this tranche:

- **Whitepaper §4.3**: `Last canonical closure` → W83-T1; `Current active tranche` → NONE (W83-T1 CLOSED); `Current posture` extended to include W80/W81/W82/W83
- **Progress tracker**: W80/W81/W82/W83 rows added; `Current active tranche` updated; `Last refreshed` updated
- **AGENT_HANDOFF**: W83-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED entry added; next-agent boundary updated

The canonical architecture snapshot version remains `v3.7-W46T1` — that version tracks the CPF barrel baseline, not documentation passes. Documentation refresh tranches (W47-T1, W59-T1, W79-T1, this W83-T1) are operational readout passes on top of the frozen snapshot.

---

## 8. Next Frontier After This Reassessment

The knowledge-native lane is closed and value-delivered. The next honest frontiers are:

1. **Benchmark execution** — promote `PROPOSAL_ONLY` knowledge benchmark targets to trace-backed evidence via an authorized GC-026 batch run (requires live inference; no pre-condition met yet)
2. **New capability** — any fresh CPF/EPF/GEF/LPF extension requires a fresh `GC-018` and must comply with `docs/reference/CVF_MAINTAINABILITY_STANDARD.md`
3. **PVV lane resume** — the 810-run Alibaba/Gemini batch is paused; resumption requires restored API-key access and a fresh `GC-018` for CP4 scoring
4. **Pre-public packaging** — `CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME` has 4 documented blockers that must be resolved before it can move from `REVIEW_REQUIRED` to `CANDIDATE`

None of these is default. All require fresh operator authorization.
