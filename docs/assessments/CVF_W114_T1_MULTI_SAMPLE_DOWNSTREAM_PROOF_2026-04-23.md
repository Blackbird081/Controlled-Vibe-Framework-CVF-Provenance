## 1. Verdict

W114-CP7 is complete as a multi-sample downstream workspace proof, with a secret-free bridge to the live Web governance evidence chain.

CVF now has evidence that the downstream adoption pattern is repeatable across three distinct
project kinds — not just the single bookmark-cli proof from W113.

All three downstream samples:

- were created outside CVF core;
- received all enforcement artifacts (AGENTS.md, `.cvf/manifest.json`, `.cvf/policy.json`, bootstrap log);
- passed workspace doctor `11/11` checks;
- passed unit tests for sample implementation;
- completed the full `INTAKE → DESIGN → BUILD → REVIEW → FREEZE` phase run;
- recorded a governance freeze receipt.

Sample 3 additionally ran the workspace-to-web evidence bridge (`write_cvf_workspace_web_evidence_bridge.ps1`),
linking workspace enforcement proof to CVF core/web release evidence without copying API keys.

**CP7 RESULT: PASS — all 3 downstream samples verified.**

## 7. What This Proves

Before W114-CP7, CVF had one downstream sample proof (W113 — bookmark-cli).

After CP7:

- The bootstrap + enforcement + doctor pattern works repeatably across three different project kinds.
- The tested bootstrap pattern makes these three downstream sample kinds agent-enforcement-ready after setup.
- The workspace-to-web evidence bridge links downstream enforcement proof to CVF Web governance evidence without distributing API keys; it does not itself replace a live release-gate run.
- The multi-sample pattern is scripted and reproducible: `scripts/w114_cp7_multi_sample_downstream_proof.ps1`.

## 8. Boundary

This assessment proves the downstream adoption pattern across three small proof samples and one secret-free bridge receipt to the live Web evidence chain.

It does not claim:

- universal downstream project compatibility without project-specific adaptation;
- provider speed, cost, or quality parity;
- Web is the full CVF runtime;
- physical sandbox isolation in Web.

Mock remains valid only for UI structure checks. Release-quality governance proof remains:

```bash
python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json
```
