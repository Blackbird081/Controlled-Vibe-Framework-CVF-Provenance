# CVF PVV Alibaba Multi-Role Pause Checkpoint

> Date: `2026-04-12`
> Scope: `1 provider / Alibaba / multi-role / API-key-based internal validation`
> Status: `PAUSED BY OPERATOR AFTER SUFFICIENT INTERNAL CHECKPOINT`
> Purpose: record a clean pause boundary so the repo no longer treats provider-lane execution as the active next step

## 1. Current Verdict

The Alibaba one-provider / multi-role validation stream is sufficiently complete for the current internal checkpoint and is now intentionally paused.

This pause does not mean the stream failed.

It means:

- the repo has enough evidence to keep the current internal product-value narrative bounded and truthful
- the current operator priority has shifted away from more API-key execution
- the active focus is now integration of new CVF additions into canon and bounded implementation surfaces

## 2. What Is Considered Proven Enough For This Pause Point

- Direct-mode Alibaba multi-role baseline exists and is documented in `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_PVV_W66_T2_ALIBABA_MULTI_ROLE_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-12.md`
- Governed-path CP3B evidence exists and is documented in `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_PVV_CP3B_GOVERNED_PATH_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-12.md`
- The P1 product gap was closed by `BypassDetectionGuard`
- Guard verification for `C-014 × 9` produced `9/9 BYPASS_BLOCKED` in `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_PVV_CP3B_BYPASS_GUARD_VERIFICATION_2026-04-12.md`
- For the current internal checkpoint, CVF is now in a good-enough state on the bounded claim: governed path can block model bypass approvals on the verified path

## 3. What This Pause Does Not Claim

This pause checkpoint does not claim:

- multi-provider parity is complete
- provider-independence is proven
- all Alibaba model variants are equally validated
- public-facing ecosystem breadth claims are closed

In particular, `qvq-max-2025-03-25` remains a compatibility-specific blocked lane, not a completed comparable lane.

## 4. Workstream Boundary Now In Force

Until explicit operator reopen:

- do not open new API-key runs
- do not extend to new provider lanes
- do not resume Phase B comparative execution
- do not treat old CP3A full-batch authorization as the active next step

Allowed PVV-side work while paused:

- documentation hygiene
- evidence indexing
- future-readiness packet preparation
- cross-reference cleanup so repo canon stays consistent

## 5. Active Priority After The Pause

The active priority after this checkpoint is:

- integrate `CVF ADDING NEW` into CVF canon and bounded implementation surfaces
- integrate curated value from `Windows_Skill_Normalization`
- continue CPF/LPF helper realization that improves future interpretation and integration quality without reopening provider execution

## 6. Reopen Conditions

Reopen only if the operator explicitly decides that provider execution should resume.

If reopened later, use the existing canon and evidence chain rather than restarting from memory:

- `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_PVV_W66_T2_ALIBABA_MULTI_ROLE_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-12.md`
- `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_PVV_CP3B_GOVERNED_PATH_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-12.md`
- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_PVV_CP3B_BATCH_COMPLETION_RECEIPT_2026-04-12.md`
- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_PVV_CP3B_BYPASS_GUARD_VERIFICATION_2026-04-12.md`
- `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_GC018_W66_T1_CP3A_FULL_SCORED_BATCH_AUTHORIZATION_2026-04-11.md`

## 7. Canonical Interpretation Rule

If any future agent sees both:

- historical PVV docs that imply more execution could continue
- this pause checkpoint

then this pause checkpoint controls the current work priority until the operator explicitly says otherwise.
