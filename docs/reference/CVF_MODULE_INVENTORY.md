# CVF Module Inventory

Status: canonical module inventory for the current repo baseline.

## Purpose

- provide one scan-friendly list of module families and their operational role
- make it easy to identify current baseline vs historical/reference-only lines
- support Phase 5 roadmap work on release and maturity discipline

## Inventory

| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.7_CONTROLLED_INTELLIGENCE/` | intelligence controls | safety line root | stable | current safety family root |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME/` | safety runtime | runtime governance | stable | tested kernel runtime line |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.7.2_SAFETY_DASHBOARD/` | dashboard | safety visibility | stable | non-coder UI layer |

| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.8.1_ADAPTIVE_OBSERVABILITY_RUNTIME/` | observability runtime | safety/observability | local-ready | current local line |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY/` | reproducibility | deterministic replay | local-ready | implemented local line |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v2.0_NONCODER_SAFETY_RUNTIME/` | non-coder safety | simplified runtime | local-ready | implemented local line |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_GUARD_CONTRACT/` | cross-channel guard contract | shared runtime guard contract | active | active helper line for mandatory gateway, governed execution runtime, and now `GC-020` transition + handoff checkpoint surfacing |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/` | control-plane foundation shell + usable intake baseline + unified retrieval contract + deterministic packaging contract + real consumer path proof | whitepaper completion `W1-T1 / CP1-CP5`, `W1-T2 / CP1-CP5` | local-ready | closed first and second control-plane tranches; `W1-T2` now canonically closed through `CP5` with intake, retrieval, packaging, and consumer-path contracts plus governed consumption receipts |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_EXECUTION_PLANE_FOUNDATION/` | execution-plane coordination shell | whitepaper completion `W2-T1 / CP1-CP5` | local-ready | closed first execution-plane tranche preserving lineage for MCP bridge, gateway, adapter, memory, prompt-preview, explainability, authorization-boundary surfacing, and explicit closure/defer posture |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_GOVERNANCE_EXPANSION_FOUNDATION/` | governance-expansion coordination shell | whitepaper completion `W3-T1 / CP1` | local-ready | closed governance-expansion tranche for operational governance modules with explicit defer of concept-only `Watchdog` and `Audit / Consensus` targets |
| `EXTENSIONS/examples/` | example contracts, registry records, adapter thought experiments, and rewrite samples | L6 ecosystem examples | active-reference | 13 tracked files across four subdirectories; distributed example owner, not a runtime or release package |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v3.0_CORE_GIT_FOR_AI/` | core primitives | layer 0 | draft | branch-track / future-facing |
| `docs/reference/` | canonical reference | source-of-truth docs | active | long-lived authoritative docs |

| `docs/baselines/` | baseline archive | snapshots/freeze | active | baseline chain |
| `docs/roadmaps/` | roadmap archive | remediation/planning | active | roadmap chain |
| `docs/reviews/` | scoped review archive | review evidence | active | module-specific review archive |

## Inventory Rules

- any new top-level extension line must be added here
- release status changes must also update `CVF_RELEASE_MANIFEST.md`
- maturity changes must also update `CVF_MATURITY_MATRIX.md`
