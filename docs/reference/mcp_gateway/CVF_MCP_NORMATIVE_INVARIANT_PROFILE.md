# CVF MCP 2026-07-28 Normative Invariant Profile

Memory class: governed-reference

Status: ACTIVE_REFERENCE

docType: reference

Date: 2026-08-23

## Purpose

Define the CVF-native interpretation of eleven selected normative MCP
`2026-07-28` invariants. The profile gives local contract and test owners a
stable fail-closed vocabulary without importing an upstream implementation or
claiming MCP interoperability.

## Scope / Applies-To

Applies to local request-profile validation, design review, negative
conformance tests, and later source-verified MCP work orders. The implementation
owner is `EXTENSIONS/CVF_EXECUTION_PLANE_FOUNDATION/src/mcp.protocol.invariant.profile.ts`.

It does not implement a client, server, transport, tool, package adapter,
network listener, authorization server, cache, subscription stream, or MRTR
runtime.

## Source / Owner Boundary

Protocol facts come from the official MCP repository pinned by MCP-KAR-T0 at
tag commit `5f5440bb26a62e2cf3440b92da5a667efa03b267`. CVF interpretation and
admission semantics remain owned by this reference folder, execution-plane
contracts, work orders, approval gates, and evidence controls.

Discovery responses, capability advertisements, TTL values, cache scopes, and
request-state fields are evidence or protocol metadata. None of them grants CVF
authorization, approval, identity, or execution authority.

| `MCP-PR-002` | `docs/specification/2026-07-28/basic/versioning.mdx`, Protocol Version Negotiation | requested version must be locally supported | `UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION`, JSON-RPC `-32022` |

| `MCP-PR-009` | `docs/specification/2026-07-28/basic/authorization/index.mdx`, Resource Parameter and Token Handling | a token must target the intended MCP server audience | `TOKEN_AUDIENCE_MISMATCH` |
| `MCP-PR-010` | `docs/specification/2026-07-28/basic/transports/streamable-http.mdx`, Header Validation | mirrored HTTP header and request-body values must agree | `HEADER_MISMATCH`, JSON-RPC `-32020` |
| `MCP-PR-011` | `docs/specification/2026-07-28/client/elicitation.mdx`, Form Mode and Security Considerations | form-mode elicitation rejects password, API-key, access-token, and payment-credential categories; unknown or malformed category metadata fails closed; URL mode may carry known sensitive categories outside the form surface | `UNSAFE_ELICITATION_REQUEST` |

All source paths in the table are relative to the pinned source mirror root:
`.private_reference/source_mirrors/modelcontextprotocol__modelcontextprotocol/`.

## Requirements

- Evaluations are deterministic, local, and side-effect free.
- Missing required metadata fails closed before capability-dependent behavior.
- Exact MCP JSON-RPC error codes are emitted only where the pinned source
  defines them; CVF-only decisions use named local decision codes.
- Multiple violated invariants may be returned together; acceptance requires
  zero violations.
- Elicitation admission receives only a closed requested-data category
  vocabulary: `password`, `api-key`, `access-token`, `payment-credential`,
  `contact`, and `profile`. It receives no requested value, credential,
  payload, storage handle, or logging field.
- Form mode rejects the four sensitive categories and fails closed for empty,
  unknown, non-string, or otherwise malformed category metadata. URL mode
  accepts known sensitive categories because collection occurs outside the
  form surface. Ordinary `contact` and `profile` form categories remain valid.
- The profile never converts discovery, cache, MRTR, or protocol metadata into
  approval or authorization.

## Verification

The focused test owner is
`EXTENSIONS/CVF_EXECUTION_PLANE_FOUNDATION/tests/mcp.protocol.invariant.profile.test.ts`.
It includes one accepted composite profile and negative cases for missing
metadata, unsupported version/capability, unnegotiated extension, untrusted
discovery use, subscription ordering/correlation, MRTR terminal misreading,
unsafe caching, audience mismatch, and HTTP header/body mismatch.
It also covers all four sensitive form categories, malformed and unknown form
metadata, sensitive URL-mode categories, ordinary contact/profile form
categories, and the unchanged accepted composite profile.

Passing these tests proves only the local contract decisions. It does not prove
wire compatibility, transport behavior, security deployment, or conformance of
an external MCP implementation.

## Claim Boundary

This profile is a private, local reference and deterministic decision contract.
It does not execute or intercept MCP traffic, validate a live peer, activate a
package, grant authority, call a provider, publish a public artifact, deploy,
or establish production readiness.
