# CVF Enterprise Evidence Pack

Status: canonical evidence-pack reference for enterprise, audit, and release approval use.

## Purpose

- package CVF governance evidence into a repeatable enterprise-facing structure
- reduce manual repo-wide searching when preparing audit or release review packets
- define a minimum acceptable evidence set for:
  - internal audit
  - release approval
  - enterprise onboarding

## Evidence Pack Principles

- use canonical artifacts only
- always attach baseline + trace, not summary-only claims
- prefer append-only evidence chains over rewritten narrative
- every packet must be reproducible from current canonical references

## Minimum Evidence Set

| Category | Required artifact types | Canonical source |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline | independent review, executive review, roadmap | `docs/reviews/cvf_phase_governance/` |
| Policy | master policy, authority matrix, risk model, guards | `governance/toolkit/` |
| Test evidence | incremental test log active window, archived test log windows, compat gates, focused/full run evidence | `docs/CVF_INCREMENTAL_TEST_LOG.md` + `docs/logs/` |
| Runtime remediation evidence | remediation receipts, remediation export log, multi-runtime evidence manifest | `docs/reviews/cvf_phase_governance/` |
| Release state | release manifest, module inventory, maturity matrix | `docs/reference/` |
| Decision authority | ADR log | `docs/CVF_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` |
| Traceability | requestId, trace batch, traceHash, remediation linkage | `docs/reviews/cvf_phase_governance/archive/CVF_UPGRADE_TRACE_2026-03-07.md` or equivalent |
| Approval / exception | approval packet, override or local-only notes | packet-specific record |

## Control Families

| Control family | Objective | Primary evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Governance authority | prove who can decide and enforce | `CVF_MASTER_POLICY.md`, authority matrix, ADRs |
| Traceability | prove why and how changes were made | upgrade trace, ADRs, test log |
| Verification | prove the claimed state was actually checked | compat gates, test log, targeted test outputs |
| Release discipline | prove current baseline vs draft vs local-only status | release manifest, inventory, maturity matrix |
| Risk and approval | prove high-impact changes were gated | risk model, approval packet, exception notes |
| Audit readiness | prove artifacts can be reviewed without manual archaeology | this evidence pack + control mapping |
