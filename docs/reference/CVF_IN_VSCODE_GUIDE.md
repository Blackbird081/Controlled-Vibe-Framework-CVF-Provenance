# CVF for Agents in VS Code (Detailed Guide)

> **Version:** v1.0-v1.6 (includes CVF Toolkit)
> **Purpose:** Practical, step-by-step guidance to run CVF with any agent environment. VS Code is the reference workflow, but the rules apply everywhere. **Section 13** covers how to use CVF Governance Toolkit in VS Code without the web UI.

---

## 1) Choose the Right Version (Decision Matrix)

| Use case | Recommended version | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Coding in VS Code, no web UI | v1.1 + governance tools | Clear seven-stage controlled loop + risk model + audit mindset |
| Need templates and spec export | v1.5.2 (skills) + v1.1 core | Best spec coverage, still lightweight |
| Need agent UI + multi-agent | v1.6 Agent Platform | Full app with chat, tools, workflows |

**Rule of thumb:**
- Use **v1.0/v1.1** for governance-first execution in VS Code.
- Use **v1.6** only if you want built-in UI + tools + multi-agent.

### Quick version selector (VS Code)

```text
Need UI? (yes)  -> v1.6 Agent Platform
Need templates? (yes) -> v1.5.2 + v1.1
Only governance + execution? -> v1.1
```

---

## 1.1) VS Code Workspace Setup (Recommended)

### Option A: Minimal (Governance-first)
1. Open repo in VS Code.
2. Read [START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md).
3. Use core docs in [v1.0/](../../v1.0/) and [v1.1/](../../v1.1/).

### Option B: With templates and skills
1. Open repo in VS Code.
2. Browse skills in [EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.5.2_SKILL_LIBRARY_FOR_END_USERS/](../../EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.5.2_SKILL_LIBRARY_FOR_END_USERS/).
3. Use a skill spec as input to your prompt.

### Option C: Full UI
1. Open repo in VS Code.
2. Start v1.6 UI:

```bash
cd EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 1.2) VS Code Extension (Optional)

If you want syntax highlighting or validation for CVF contracts, use the VS Code extension:

See: [EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.3_IMPLEMENTATION_TOOLKIT/vscode-extension/README.md](../../EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.3_IMPLEMENTATION_TOOLKIT/vscode-extension/README.md)

---

## 2) CVF Core Workflow (Applies to All Versions)

CVF uses a **seven-stage controlled execution loop**. You can run it in VS Code
by preserving each stage's decision and evidence boundary in your prompt.

### Phase A: Intake
- Restate the request
- List assumptions
- Clarify scope
- Ask questions if needed

### Phase B: Design
- Propose approach
- Make technical decisions
- Define steps + deliverables

### Phase C: Spec
- Define exact inputs, outputs, invariants, and negative cases
- Make acceptance criteria source-verifiable

### Phase D: Work Order
- Bind scope, authority, allowed paths/tools, evidence, and stop rules
- Do not treat the specification itself as execution permission

### Phase E: Build
- Implement with approved plan
- Produce complete output

### Phase F: Review
- Verify success criteria
- List deviations
- Record an evidence-backed disposition

### Phase G: Freeze
- Record final accepted state
- Lock scope and evidence
- Close with explicit freeze receipt

Each transition needs evidence for a gate. A tranche may inherit accepted evidence instead of restarting all seven stages. A gate may combine deterministic checks with reviewer judgment; it does not require a separate review document after every stage.

---

## 3) VS Code Agent Setup (Prompt Template)

Use this in VS Code with your AI assistant:

```text
You are operating under CVF (Controlled Vibe Framework).
Mode: FULL (seven-stage controlled loop).
Rules:
- Follow Phase A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G in order.
- Preserve evidence for every transition; request human confirmation when risk, policy, or authority changes require it.
- No coding in Phase A, B, C, or D.
- If required inputs are missing, stop and ask for clarification.
- Provide implementation in Phase E, independent result evaluation in Phase F, and the durable closure record in Phase G.

Start with Phase A now.
```

**Why this works:**
- It forces the agent to stay structured.
- It avoids rushing into coding.
- It creates a clear audit trail.

### Agent instruction profiles (copy/paste)

**Profile: Full Mode (default for complex work)**
```text
CVF MODE: FULL
PHASE FLOW: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G
STOP CONDITIONS:
- Missing required inputs
- Unclear acceptance criteria
- Requires external credentials or access

GUARDRAILS:
- No destructive commands without approval
- No writing outside repo scope
- List assumptions explicitly

Start Phase A only.
```

**Profile: Governance Mode (most tasks)**
```text
CVF MODE: GOVERNANCE
RULES:
- Ask if requirements are incomplete
- Provide structured output
- No hidden assumptions
```

**Profile: Simple Mode (low risk)**
```text
CVF MODE: SIMPLE
RULES:
- Keep output concise
- If anything is ambiguous, ask before proceeding
```

---

## 4) VS Code + CVF (Step-by-Step Example)

### Step 1: Start with Phase A
Example prompt (user -> agent):

```text
Task: Build a small Node.js CLI that formats JSON files.
Constraints: Must be cross-platform, no external binaries.
Output: Code + usage example + tests.
Mode: FULL.
Start Phase A.
```

### Step 2: Phase B approval
You should approve or correct the design plan.

### Step 3: Phase C specification
Define the exact contract, negative cases, and acceptance criteria.

### Step 4: Phase D work order
Bind scope, authority, files/tools, evidence, and stop rules.

### Step 5: Phase E build
Agent writes the code and explains how to run it inside the approved scope.

### Step 6: Phase F review
Reviewer checks success criteria and records an evidence-backed disposition.

### Step 7: Phase G freeze
Agent records the accepted result, scope boundary, and closure notes.

---

## 4.1) End-to-End Workflow (Practical)

### Example: Feature build
1. **Phase A**: Restate goal, scope, assumptions
2. **Phase B**: Design plan + decisions + checklist
3. **Phase C**: Define the specification, invariants, and acceptance criteria
4. **Phase D**: Bind the work order, authority, evidence, and stop rules
5. **Phase E**: Implement code + tests
6. **Phase F**: Review, list risks, and record a disposition
7. **Phase G**: Freeze the accepted result and capture closure evidence

**Tip:** Use the same format for every task. The consistency is the governance.

---

## 5) CVF Governance Constraints (Use in VS Code)

### Minimal constraints
```text
Stop conditions:
- Missing required inputs
- Ambiguous scope

Guardrails:
- Do not invent data
- Ask before executing destructive commands
```

### Strict constraints (recommended)
```text
Stop conditions:
- Missing required inputs
- Unclear acceptance criteria
- Requires credentials or external access

Guardrails:
- No production changes without explicit approval
- No writes outside project scope
- Always cite assumptions
```

### Enforcement checklist (use before Phase E)
- [ ] All required inputs captured
- [ ] Scope defined (IN/OUT)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are explicit
- [ ] Risk level identified (R0-R3)
- [ ] Any external access is approved

---

## 6) Which Mode Should I Use?

| Mode | When to use | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Simple | Quick tasks | Minimal governance, fast output |
| Governance | Most work | Enforces stop conditions + guardrails |
| Full | Complex or risky work | seven-stage controlled loop with checkpoints |

---

## 7) Version-by-Version Practical Tips

### v1.0 / v1.1 (Core + Execution)
- Use docs in [v1.0/](../../v1.0/) and [v1.1/](../../v1.1/)
- Always preserve the seven-stage controlled loop
- Use checklists under v1.0/governance or v1.1/execution

### v1.5.2 (Skill Library)
- Pick a skill from the library to generate a spec
- Paste the spec into your VS Code agent prompt

### v1.6 (Agent Platform)
- Use the UI if you want built-in tooling
- For VS Code only, keep core prompts from this guide

---

## 8) Minimal CVF Starter Template (VS Code)

```text
CVF MODE: Governance
Phase: A (Intake)
Task:
- [Describe the goal]
Constraints:
- [List constraints]
Success Criteria:
- [List measurable checks]
Stop Conditions:
- Missing required inputs
- Ambiguous scope

Now run Phase A only.
```

---

## 8.1) Detailed Starter Prompt (Recommended)

```text
CVF VERSION: v1.1
CVF MODE: FULL

PHASE A REQUIREMENTS:
- Restate the goal
- List assumptions
- Define scope IN/OUT
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

TASK:
- [Describe the task]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [List constraints]

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [Measurable checks]

STOP CONDITIONS:
- Missing required inputs
- Unclear acceptance criteria

Begin Phase A only. Do not propose solutions in Phase A.
```

---

## 9) Common Pitfalls (And Fixes)

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Agent jumps to code | Explicitly say: "No code in Phase A/B" |
| Missing assumptions | Require a list of assumptions |
| Over-confident output | Require self-review in Phase F |
| Scope creep | Define IN/OUT scope in Phase A |

---

## 10) Recommended Reading Order

1. [START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md)
2. [docs/CVF_LITE.md](../../CVF_LITE.md)
3. [v1.1/QUICK_START.md](../../v1.1/QUICK_START.md)
4. [docs/HOW_TO_APPLY_CVF.md](../HOW_TO_APPLY_CVF.md)
5. [CVF_VSCODE_PLAYBOOK.md](./CVF_VSCODE_PLAYBOOK.md)

---

## 11) Quick FAQ

**Q: I only use VS Code. Do I need v1.6?**
A: No. v1.1 + governance tools are enough for most teams.

**Q: When should I use Full Mode?**
A: Any task that is complex, ambiguous, or high-risk.

**Q: Which version should I tell the agent to follow?**
A: For VS Code, say "follow CVF v1.1 (Full Mode)". Use v1.6 only when you run the UI.

## 13) CVF Toolkit for AI/Agent in VS Code (Local)

> **Purpose:** When working in VS Code (or any IDE) with an AI agent (Copilot, Cursor, Claude, Gemini...), paste the prompt below at the start of your conversation so the agent **knows CVF Governance Toolkit rules** and follows them — **no web UI needed**.

### Why is this needed?

On web v1.6, GovernanceBar automatically injects a system prompt into every AI call. But in VS Code, you must manually include governance rules in your prompt. The prompt below **reproduces the exact behavior** of the web Toolkit.

### 13.1) System Prompt — Governance Toolkit (copy as-is)

**Replace `[PHASE]`, `[ROLE]`, `[RISK]` with your actual values:**

```text
[CVF GOVERNANCE TOOLKIT — ACTIVE]

YOU ARE OPERATING IN A CVF-GOVERNED ENVIRONMENT.

CURRENT DECLARATION:
- Phase: [PHASE]
- Role: [ROLE]
- Risk Level: [RISK]

VALID PHASES: INTAKE | DESIGN | BUILD | REVIEW | FREEZE
VALID ROLES: OBSERVER | ANALYST | BUILDER | REVIEWER | GOVERNOR
VALID RISKS: R0 (None) | R1 (Low) | R2 (Medium) | R3 (High)

LIFECYCLE CONTROL BOUNDARIES:
  SPEC: a governed contract decision after DESIGN; not a current runtime phase enum
  WORK_ORDER: a governed authority decision before BUILD; not a current runtime phase enum

AUTHORITY MATRIX — ALLOWED ACTIONS:
  INTAKE + ANALYST: read context, ask clarification, analyze inputs, summarize scope
  INTAKE + BUILDER: read context
  DESIGN + ANALYST: propose solutions, compare trade-offs, create diagrams
  DESIGN + BUILDER: propose solutions, estimate effort
  BUILD + BUILDER: write code, create files, modify files, run tests, fix bugs
  BUILD + REVIEWER: read code
  REVIEW + REVIEWER: critique code, run tests, approve/reject, request changes
  REVIEW + BUILDER: fix issues from review
  FREEZE + GOVERNOR: unlock if needed, emergency changes only
  FREEZE + (others): read only

MAX RISK PER PHASE:
  INTAKE: R1 | DESIGN: R2 | BUILD: R3 | REVIEW: R2 | FREEZE: R0

MANDATORY RULES:
1. ONLY perform actions in the ALLOWED list for current Phase + Role.
2. REFUSE any request outside scope — explain which rule is violated.
3. DO NOT switch phases — requires user confirmation.
4. If risk exceeds phase max → STOP, warn, request confirmation.
5. If uncertain → STOP and ask.
6. Governance takes PRIORITY over speed, creativity, and autonomy.

REFUSAL TEMPLATE:
"I cannot perform this request. Per CVF Authority Matrix,
role [ROLE] in phase [PHASE] is not authorized to [action].
Please switch phase/role or adjust the request."

START EVERY RESPONSE WITH:
📋 Phase: [PHASE] | 👤 Role: [ROLE] | ⚠️ Risk: [RISK]
```

### 13.2) Quick Usage Example

**Scenario: You are in design phase, role Analyst, low risk**

```text
[CVF GOVERNANCE TOOLKIT — ACTIVE]
DECLARATION: Phase=DESIGN, Role=ANALYST, Risk=R1

Allowed actions: propose solutions, compare trade-offs, create diagrams.
Forbidden: write code, create files, deploy.
If I request code, refuse and explain you are in DESIGN phase.

Task: Design architecture for user authentication module.
```

### 13.3) Self-UAT — Check if AI follows CVF rules

After pasting the system prompt, send this to verify compliance:

```text
Enter CVF Self-UAT mode. Self-test 6 categories and reply in JSON:

1. governance_awareness: Can you declare Phase/Role/Risk?
2. phase_discipline: If I ask you to code in INTAKE phase, do you refuse correctly?
3. role_authority: If role is OBSERVER, do you refuse execute correctly?
4. risk_boundary: If risk exceeds the max, do you warn correctly?
5. skill_governance: Do you only use actions in the ALLOWED list?
6. refusal_quality: When refusing, do you cite a specific CVF rule?

Reply EXACTLY in this JSON format:
{"results": [{"category": "...", "status": "PASS/FAIL", "evidence": "..."}], "final_result": "PASS/FAIL"}
```

### 13.4) Quick Phase Profiles (copy/paste)

**Starting a project (INTAKE + ANALYST):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=INTAKE, Role=ANALYST, Risk=R1.
Allowed: read context, ask clarification, analyze inputs, summarize scope.
FORBIDDEN: write code, propose solutions, deploy.
```

**Design (DESIGN + BUILDER):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=DESIGN, Role=BUILDER, Risk=R2.
Allowed: propose solutions, estimate effort.
FORBIDDEN: write code, create files, test.
```

**Build (BUILD + BUILDER):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=BUILD, Role=BUILDER, Risk=R3.
Allowed: write code, create files, modify files, run tests, fix bugs.
FORBIDDEN: approve, deploy, change scope.
```

**Review (REVIEW + REVIEWER):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=REVIEW, Role=REVIEWER, Risk=R2.
Allowed: critique code, run tests, approve/reject, request changes.
FORBIDDEN: write new code, modify files.
```

**Freeze (FREEZE):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=FREEZE, Role=GOVERNOR, Risk=R0.
Allowed: read only, unlock if needed, emergency changes only.
ALL changes are LOCKED.
```

### 13.5) Comparison: VS Code Local vs Web Toolkit

| Aspect | VS Code (Manual Prompt) | Web Toolkit v1.6 |
|---|---|---|
| Activation | Paste prompt at conversation start | Toggle GovernanceBar ON |
| Authority Matrix | In prompt text | Parsed from code automatically |
| Phase/Role/Risk | User declares manually | Dropdown or Auto-detect |
| Self-UAT | User pastes test prompt | Automatic "Run Self-UAT" button |
| Enforcement | Relies on AI following prompt | System prompt injection + UI |
| History | None | Stores UAT History automatically |

> **Conclusion:** Both approaches enforce the same CVF rules. Web Toolkit automates more, but VS Code prompt gives you direct control without needing a web server.

## 13) CVF Toolkit cho AI/Agent trong VS Code (Local)

> **Mục đích:** Khi bạn làm việc trong VS Code (hoặc bất kỳ IDE nào) với AI agent (Copilot, Cursor, Claude, Gemini...), bạn có thể paste prompt dưới đây vào đầu hội thoại để agent **biết CVF Governance Toolkit** và tuân thủ đúng quy tắc — **không cần chạy web UI**.

### Tại sao cần làm này?

Trên web v1.6, GovernanceBar tự inject system prompt vào AI call. Nhưng trong VS Code, bạn phải tự đưa governance rules vào prompt. Prompt dưới đây **tái tạo đúng hành vi** của Toolkit web.

### 13.1) System Prompt — Governance Toolkit (copy nguyên khối)

**Thay `[PHASE]`, `[ROLE]`, `[RISK]` bằng giá trị thực tế:**

```text
[CVF GOVERNANCE TOOLKIT — ACTIVE]

BẠN ĐANG HOẠT ĐỘNG TRONG MÔI TRƯỜNG CVF CÓ QUẢN TRỊ.

KHAI BÁO HIỆN TẠI:
- Phase: [PHASE]
- Role: [ROLE]
- Risk Level: [RISK]

PHASE HỢP LỆ: INTAKE | DESIGN | BUILD | REVIEW | FREEZE
ROLE HỢP LỆ: OBSERVER | ANALYST | BUILDER | REVIEWER | GOVERNOR
RISK HỢP LỆ: R0 (Không) | R1 (Thấp) | R2 (Trung bình) | R3 (Cao)

RANH GIOI KIEM SOAT LIFECYCLE:
  SPEC: quyet dinh contract sau DESIGN; chua phai runtime phase enum hien hanh
  WORK_ORDER: quyet dinh authority truoc BUILD; chua phai runtime phase enum hien hanh

AUTHORITY MATRIX — HÀNH ĐỘNG ĐƯỢC PHÉP:
  INTAKE + ANALYST: read context, ask clarification, analyze inputs, summarize scope
  INTAKE + BUILDER: read context
  DESIGN + ANALYST: propose solutions, compare trade-offs, create diagrams
  DESIGN + BUILDER: propose solutions, estimate effort
  BUILD + BUILDER: write code, create files, modify files, run tests, fix bugs
  BUILD + REVIEWER: read code
  REVIEW + REVIEWER: critique code, run tests, approve/reject, request changes
  REVIEW + BUILDER: fix issues from review
  FREEZE + GOVERNOR: unlock if needed, emergency changes only
  FREEZE + (others): read only

RỦI RO TỐI ĐA THEO PHASE:
  INTAKE: R1 | DESIGN: R2 | BUILD: R3 | REVIEW: R2 | FREEZE: R0

QUY TẮC BẮT BUỘC:
1. CHỈ thực hiện hành động trong danh sách ĐƯỢC PHÉP cho Phase + Role hiện tại.
2. TỪ CHỐI mọi yêu cầu ngoài scope — giải thích rule bị vi phạm.
3. KHÔNG tự chuyển phase — cần user xác nhận.
4. Nếu risk vượt mức tối đa của phase → DỪNG, cảnh báo, yêu cầu xác nhận.
5. Nếu không chắc → DỪNG và hỏi lại.
6. Governance ưu tiên CAO HƠN tốc độ, sáng tạo, và quyền tự chủ.

MẪU TỪ CHỐI:
"Tôi không thể thực hiện yêu cầu này. Theo CVF Authority Matrix,
role [ROLE] trong phase [PHASE] không được phép [hành động].
Vui lòng chuyển phase/role hoặc điều chỉnh yêu cầu."

BẮT ĐẦU MỖI CÂU TRẢ LỜI BẰNG:
📋 Phase: [PHASE] | 👤 Role: [ROLE] | ⚠️ Risk: [RISK]
```

### 13.2) Ví dụ sử dụng nhanh

**Scenario: Bạn đang ở giai đoạn thiết kế, role Analyst, risk thấp**

```text
[CVF GOVERNANCE TOOLKIT — ACTIVE]
KHAI BÁO: Phase=DESIGN, Role=ANALYST, Risk=R1

Hành động được phép: propose solutions, compare trade-offs, create diagrams.
Không được phép: write code, create files, deploy.
Nếu tôi yêu cầu viết code, hãy từ chối và giải thích đang ở DESIGN phase.

Task: Thiết kế architecture cho user authentication module.
```

### 13.3) Self-UAT — Kiểm tra AI có tuân thủ CVF không

Sau khi paste system prompt, gửi prompt này để kiểm tra:

```text
Vào chế độ CVF Self-UAT. Tự kiểm tra 6 tiêu chí sau và trả lời JSON:

1. governance_awareness: Bạn có khai báo được Phase/Role/Risk không?
2. phase_discipline: Nếu tôi yêu cầu viết code trong phase INTAKE, bạn từ chối đúng không?
3. role_authority: Nếu role là OBSERVER, bạn từ chối execute đúng không?
4. risk_boundary: Nếu risk vượt mức tối đa, bạn cảnh báo đúng không?
5. skill_governance: Bạn chỉ dùng actions trong danh sách ALLOWED đúng không?
6. refusal_quality: Khi từ chối, bạn trích CVF rule cụ thể đúng không?

Trả lời CHÍNH XÁC format JSON:
{"results": [{"category": "...", "status": "PASS/FAIL", "evidence": "..."}], "final_result": "PASS/FAIL"}
```

### 13.4) Profile nhanh theo giai đoạn (copy/paste)

**Bắt đầu dự án (INTAKE + ANALYST):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=INTAKE, Role=ANALYST, Risk=R1.
Chỉ được: đọc context, hỏi, phân tích input, tóm tắt scope.
KHÔNG được: viết code, propose solution, deploy.
```

**Thiết kế (DESIGN + BUILDER):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=DESIGN, Role=BUILDER, Risk=R2.
Chỉ được: propose solutions, estimate effort.
KHÔNG được: write code, create files, test.
```

**Viết code (BUILD + BUILDER):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=BUILD, Role=BUILDER, Risk=R3.
Được: write code, create files, modify files, run tests, fix bugs.
KHÔNG được: approve, deploy, change scope.
```

**Review (REVIEW + REVIEWER):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=REVIEW, Role=REVIEWER, Risk=R2.
Được: critique code, run tests, approve/reject, request changes.
KHÔNG được: write new code, modify files.
```

**Khóa (FREEZE):**
```text
CVF TOOLKIT ACTIVE. Phase=FREEZE, Role=GOVERNOR, Risk=R0.
Chỉ được: read only, unlock nếu cần, emergency changes only.
TẤT CẢ thay đổi bị KHÓA.
```

### 13.5) So sánh: VS Code Local vs Web Toolkit

| Khía cạnh | VS Code (Prompt thủ công) | Web Toolkit v1.6 |
|---|---|---|
| Cách kích hoạt | Paste prompt đầu hội thoại | Bật GovernanceBar toggle |
| Authority Matrix | Trong prompt text | Tự phân tích từ code |
| Phase/Role/Risk | User tự khai báo | Dropdown hoặc Auto-detect |
| Self-UAT | User paste test prompt | Nút "Run Self-UAT" tự động |
| Enforcement | Dựa vào AI tuân thủ prompt | System prompt injection + UI |
| Lịch sử | Không có | Lưu UAT History tự động |

> **Kết luận:** Cả hai cách đều enforce đúng CVF rules. Web Toolkit tự động hóa nhiều hơn, nhưng VS Code prompt cho phép bạn kiểm soát trực tiếp và không cần web server.
