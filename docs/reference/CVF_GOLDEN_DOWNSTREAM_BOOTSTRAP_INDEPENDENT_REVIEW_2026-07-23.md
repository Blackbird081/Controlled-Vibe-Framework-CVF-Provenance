# CVF Golden Downstream Bootstrap — Independent Review Receipt

Memory class: EVIDENCE_RECORD

Status: IMPORTED_SUPERSEDED_BY_PROVENANCE_REVIEW

docType: reference

Text Encoding Exception: preserve Unicode punctuation from the imported
public review title; no machine-readable token depends on it.

## Purpose

Preserve the original independent-review receipt as historical tranche
evidence while a separate provenance reviewer reconciles repository boundaries.

## Target / Scope Under Review

The target is the originating golden-downstream bootstrap changed set. This
receipt does not review the later public-first synchronization defect.

- Tranche: `CVF-BSL-T1`
- Date: 2026-07-23
- Reviewer: Codex
- Review baseline: `2c59f6ac1317507628d9ae420c19e2dc4704d329`
- Risk: R2
- Disposition: `REVIEW_PASS`

## Scope reviewed

The changed set was compared with `CVF-BSL-T1-WO` and authorized Amendment 1.
All 18 resulting paths are inside the amended ceiling. No excluded path,
provider configuration, secret, downstream repository or runtime extension
is included.

```

The reviewer inspected the catalog state classifier, closed-schema
validation, source-backed module vocabulary, bootstrap/doctor completeness
lists, fresh-clone initializer gate, cleanup safety boundary and both
BSL-R8 failure paths. The harness independently demonstrated:

- legacy/mixed project-owned catalog content is preserved;
- damaged governed kits cannot fall back to legacy;
- a damaged registry and a manager validation failure both make bootstrap
  exit non-zero without a success claim;
- generated views are deterministic and drift-blocking;
- all named invalid registry cases are rejected;
- the initializer must exit 0 and recreate its ignored binding;
- no hermetic temp residue remains.

## Finding disposition

`BSL-R1` through `BSL-R9` are CLOSED. Full findings and repair history remain
in:

- `CVF_GOLDEN_DOWNSTREAM_BOOTSTRAP_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_FINDINGS_2026-07-23.md`
- `CVF_GOLDEN_DOWNSTREAM_BOOTSTRAP_BUILD_EVIDENCE_2026-07-23.md`

## Claim boundary

This review proves a stronger, machine-governed bootstrap foundation and its
structural failure behavior. It does not migrate an existing downstream
project, update a downstream core pin, prove application runtime behavior or
make a live AI-governance claim. No provider call or secret was required.

## Commit authorization

The reviewer authorizes COMMIT_STEWARD to create the work-order C1/C2/C3
stack by explicit path staging, rehearse it in a disposable worktree, and
fast-forward public-core `main` only if the remote baseline remains
`6ce1cf00c31a7f825d4c3fa3e66e8a3509e4a4b2`.
