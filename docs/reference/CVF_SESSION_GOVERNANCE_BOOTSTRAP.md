# CVF Session Governance Bootstrap

Memory class: POINTER_RECORD

Status: canonical session-start front door for loading only the governance controls that matter right now.

## Purpose

- give every new or resumed session one short governance front door
- reduce context load by routing to relevant controls instead of rereading every guard
- keep session-start behavior aligned with the CVF memory / handoff / phase-bounded loading model

## Always-On Bootstrap

Read these first:

- `CVF_SESSION_MEMORY.md`
- `CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_SESSION_STATE.json`
- `docs/reference/CVF_GOVERNANCE_CONTROL_MATRIX.md`
- `docs/reference/CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
- `docs/roadmaps/CVF_WHITEPAPER_COMPLETION_ROADMAP_2026-03-21.md`
- `governance/compat/CVF_SURFACE_SCAN_REGISTRY.json` before opening a fresh quality assessment or choosing the next tranche by scan state

If the active workline is not the whitepaper completion line, replace the roadmap/tracker pair above with the canonical tracker and roadmap for that workline.

## Current Canonical Status First

Before loading deeper history:

- check the current tracker or status review first
- check the current active roadmap second
- use closure packets and deltas only when the next step actually depends on them

Do not start by reading all governance guards in full.

## Trigger-Based Controls

Load these only when the task or transition triggers them:

### `GC-018` — Continuation / Deepening / Marginal-Value Stop Boundary

Use when:

- reopening or extending a materially delivered wave
- validation/test continuation is being proposed
- packaging-only or truth/claim continuation is being proposed

Primary references:

- `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/CVF_DEPTH_AUDIT_GUARD.md`
- `docs/reference/CVF_GC018_CONTINUATION_CANDIDATE_TEMPLATE.md`
- `docs/reference/CVF_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_STANDARD.md`
- `docs/reference/CVF_MAINTAINABILITY_STANDARD.md` when touching governed public barrels, barrel smoke, shared batch helpers, or canonical summary surfaces
- active quality assessment for the current workline before deciding remediation-first vs expansion-now

### `GC-019` — Structural Change Audit Gate

Use when:

- merging modules
- moving ownership across planes
- changing package boundaries or physical layout

Primary references:

- `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/CVF_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE_AUDIT_GUARD.md`
- `docs/reference/CVF_GC019_STRUCTURAL_CHANGE_AUDIT_TEMPLATE.md`

### `GC-020` — Pause / Transfer / Resume Truth

Use when:

- work pauses before closure
- ownership shifts to another worker or agent
- a later resume would otherwise depend on hidden memory

- `docs/reference/CVF_AGENT_HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`

Operational note:

- write the tracked remote branch into handoff when an upstream exists
- derive exact remote SHA live from git when push or resume logic depends on it

### `GC-023` — Governed File Size

Use when:

  semantic-region ledger, architecture reconciliation, Memory synthesis,
  graphification plan, or retrieval-readiness claim;
- source assets must remain distinguishable from graph, Palace, cache,
  snapshot, summary, and retrieval views;

## Task-Class Routing

Use this routing table after reading the always-on bootstrap:

| Task class | Load next |
|---|---|
| continuation or breadth/deepening proposal | `GC-018` |
| structural merge or package move | `GC-019` |
| pause, resume, shift handoff, agent transfer | `GC-020` |
| multi-agent intake review, rebuttal, or decision-pack drafting | `GC-027` |
| live boardroom deliberation in intake/design flow | `GC-028` + `AI Boardroom` protocol + active roadmap |
| extension-local source, test, or package-config changes | `GC-029` |
| creating or materially revising governance guards | `GC-030` + guard registry |
| drafting or materially revising governed artifacts | `GC-032` + source truth + active roadmap/tranche packet |
| fresh quality assessment or next-surface selection | `GC-041` + canonical scan registry + active tracker |
| product-value validation, comparative value proof, or Docker-trigger justification | `GC-042` + frozen corpus/rubric/run-manifest/assessment chain |
| future knowledge absorption, repo-derived skill intake, or post-closure synthesis-first uplift planning | `CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_SESSION_STATE.json` + `GC-043` + knowledge-absorption priority standard + active handoff |
| reading, inventorying, extracting, comparing, summarizing, auditing, migrating, or absorbing a bounded file/folder corpus | `GC-047` + corpus completeness and report-integrity standard |
| corpus-derived knowledge map, semantic-region ledger, architecture reconciliation, Memory synthesis, graphification, or retrieval-readiness claim | `GC-047` + `GC-048` + Knowledge System Method + map reconciliation standard |
| template/skill corpus rescreen, future front-door template intake, or trusted-subset admission | `CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_SESSION_STATE.json` + `GC-044` + corpus rescreen standard + active handoff |
| touching governed public barrels, barrel smoke tests, shared batch helpers, or canonical summary surfaces | `GC-033` + `GC-034` + `GC-035` + `GC-036` + `docs/reference/CVF_MAINTAINABILITY_STANDARD.md` |
| large file touched or split candidate | `GC-023` |
| tests near a split canonical test surface | `GC-024` |
| ordinary tranche-local implementation already authorized | active roadmap + tranche packet only |

## Memory / Handoff / Bootstrap Separation

- memory = durable facts, history, and evidence
- handoff = truthful transition checkpoint
- bootstrap = minimal governance routing for session start
- session memory front door = one active pointer set for agents and future
  `cvf-cli` / `cvf-mcp-server` startup

Do not use one of these layers as a substitute for the others.

## If Unsure

If routing is uncertain:

1. read the active roadmap and tracker first
2. choose the likely triggered control
3. if pause/transfer ambiguity exists, default to `GC-020`
4. if continuation/deepening ambiguity exists, default to `GC-018`
5. if value-proof or Docker-justification ambiguity exists, default to `GC-042`
6. if repo-derived knowledge or skill uplift ambiguity exists, default to `GC-043`
7. if a bounded file/folder corpus informs a report or decision, default to `GC-047`
8. if corpus-derived knowledge mapping, graphification, or Memory synthesis ambiguity exists, default to `GC-047` + `GC-048`
9. if template/skill front-door quality or trusted-subset ambiguity exists, default to `GC-044`
