Status: release-readiness checkpoint for the current local remediation baseline.

## Purpose

- capture the truthful whole-system status after the remediation waves executed on `2026-03-19` to `2026-03-20`
- distinguish implemented reality from remaining roadmap work
- provide one short audit anchor for future reassessment

## Readiness Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical phase model | `ALIGNED` | active runtime, shared guard contract, and major Web surfaces now use `INTAKE -> DESIGN -> BUILD -> REVIEW -> FREEZE` |
| Hardened default guard path | `ALIGNED` | `ai_commit` and `fileScope` are wired into the hardened default path in active remediated runtime areas |
| Web non-coder semantics | `SUBSTANTIALLY ALIGNED` | key UX surfaces teach canonical phase semantics, onboarding now hands off into a governed starter flow, and the active Web reference line provides nine governed live execution paths |
| Cross-extension workflow realism | `SUBSTANTIALLY ALIGNED` | explicit step lifecycle, default runtime bindings, receipt-backed execution, and a reusable SDK reference loop now exist for the governed path |
| Governance executable ownership | `SUBSTANTIALLY ALIGNED` | canonical control matrix now maps critical rules to runtime guard, gateway, approval, or CI owner; remaining caveat is ecosystem breadth, not owner ambiguity |
| End-to-end controlled autonomy loop | `SUBSTANTIALLY ALIGNED` | coder-facing and non-coder active reference paths now both have governed loop evidence, though not every channel family is equally mature |
| Continuation-stop governance | `ALIGNED` | `GC-018` continuation control is now repository-enforced via local hook + CI compatibility gate, and the current `P3` defer posture is backed by a canonical scored continuation packet |
| Documentation truthfulness | `ALIGNED WITH CAVEATS` | canonical entry docs updated to stop overstating legacy or incomplete behavior |

## Implemented Strengths

- canonical runtime phases are now operationally represented
- shared contract and major Web/API entrypoints no longer default to the legacy `4-phase / 6-guard` framing
- non-coder UX now exposes the canonical `FREEZE` posture instead of stopping at `REVIEW`
- onboarding now opens Quick Start, which emits a persisted governed starter handoff before the routed starter wizard is launched
- App Builder Wizard, Business Strategy Wizard, Research Project Wizard, Product Design Wizard, Data Analysis Wizard, Content Strategy Wizard, and Marketing Campaign Wizard now provide governed live paths that reach the Web execute pipeline with pre-bound `BUILD`, risk, scope, and skill-preflight metadata
- the active `cvf-web` production build now passes again after the latest Web build-blocker closure batch
- workflow bridge no longer auto-completes implicitly and can execute registered handlers with explicit results
- mandatory gateway and governed helper runtime now surface approval-required boundaries and execution lineage explicitly
- active guarded runtime paths now surface explicit `GC-020` handoff checkpoints for governed pause and approval-required escalation
- baseline/update governance now has policy, CI, and local hook enforcement
- post-closure continuation governance (`GC-018`) now has a dedicated compat checker in both CI and the local pre-push chain
- the current breadth-defer posture is no longer only roadmap prose; it is also recorded in one canonical scored packet for `P3`
- a canonical governance control matrix now assigns one primary enforcement owner to each critical control
- public SDK/OpenAPI surfaces now publish canonical phases while confining legacy `DISCOVERY` support to explicit normalization boundaries
- key user-facing guides now teach the canonical 5-phase controlled loop instead of the formerly active 4-phase framing
- `CvfSdk.runReferenceGovernedLoop()` now provides one reusable coder-facing governed execution path with auto-supplied `ai_commit`, `traceHash`, approval handling, freeze artifact, and checkpoint receipt
- the non-coder reference packet now has nine live governed launch paths instead of being only a documentation-grade handoff artifact
- the system-unification remediation roadmap should now be read as complete for the active wave, with future work redirected into reassessment or `GC-018` continuation handling

## Open Risks

1. The reference governed path is real, but broader adapter coverage across every extension family is still narrower than a full ecosystem mesh.
2. Some secondary or ecosystem-specific controls still rely on the reference runtime rather than every extension family exposing identical maturity.
3. CVF can credibly claim governed reference control loops for both coder-facing and multiple non-coder active paths, but not yet "fully unified controlled autonomy" across all active channels.
4. Breadth expansion after the current active-path closure is no longer an open default; it now requires a freshly scored `GC-018` continuation checkpoint.
5. The active reference path should now be read as depth-frozen for the current wave unless a new scored continuation candidate reopens it.
6. `GC-020` is now stronger on the active runtime path, but universal pause/transfer interception across every session/channel boundary is still not complete.

## Positioning Guidance

Current safe claim:

> CVF is a governance-first control plane for AI-assisted execution with a substantially aligned canonical runtime on the active reference path, while future continuation remains gated by `GC-018`.

Claims to avoid for now:

- "fully autonomous under complete control"
- "fully unified across every channel"
- "platform parity with broader orchestration ecosystems"

## Verdict

Current local baseline is suitable for:

- continued hardening
- controlled internal use
- governance-oriented demonstrations
- coder-facing governed reference demonstrations
- non-coder governed reference demonstrations on the active Web path
- active `cvf-web` production-build demonstrations on the current local baseline
- further release-readiness preparation
- future continuation reassessment under `GC-018`

Current local baseline is not yet justified for:

- strongest possible "fully unified" marketing claims
- declaring all roadmap-level governance ownership gaps closed
- treating cross-extension execution semantics as fully production-complete
- claiming that non-coder and coder-facing governed demo paths are equally mature everywhere
- reopening roadmap breadth expansion without a fresh `GC-018` continuation score

## Public-Facing Documentation Freshness Check

Before any public-sync commit, release claim, or public catalog update, verify
the following against current source:

| Item | Source of truth | Check required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/GET_STARTED.md` version string (footer) | `CHANGELOG.md` — top-level version entry | Must match current GA version (e.g. v4.0.0) |
| `docs/GET_STARTED.md` skill count | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.5.2_SKILL_LIBRARY_FOR_END_USERS/README.md` — "Tổng Skills" row | Must match or use a stable pointer instead of a hardcoded number |
| Public catalog capability rows | `docs/reference/CVF_TECHNICAL_PRODUCT_CATALOG_2026-05-18.md` | Each row status and evidence path must be Test-Path verified in the public-sync clone |

Failure to check these before a public-sync commit is the root cause of the
version drift identified in the 2026-06-05 external review gap analysis
(`docs/audits/CVF_EXTERNAL_REVIEW_GAP_ANALYSIS_AND_PROPOSED_SOLUTIONS_2026-06-05.md`,
GAP 3).
