# CVF Pre-Public P3 Readiness

Memory class: POINTER_RECORD
Status: current readiness reference that must be consulted before any `P3` structural relocation authorization.

## Purpose

- convert `P0-P2` from broad preparation into explicit `P3` readiness evidence
- close the known review gaps before any folder move is discussed as executable work
- preserve one canonical place that says what is ready, what still needs curation, and what still needs packaging

## Readiness Rule

`P3` must stay blocked unless all of the following remain true:

1. `P0`, `P1`, and `P2` are formally closed in `governance/compat/CVF_PREPUBLIC_PHASE_GATE_REGISTRY.json`
2. every visible root file is exposure-classified in `governance/compat/CVF_ROOT_FILE_EXPOSURE_REGISTRY.json`
3. every `PUBLIC_DOCS_ONLY` root declares an explicit public-content audit status
4. every `PUBLIC_EXPORT_CANDIDATE` extension declares an explicit export-readiness status
5. the publication decision memo still has a live re-assessment date
6. any future physical relocation wave executes on a dedicated `restructuring/p3-*` branch
7. any future physical relocation wave executes from a secondary git worktree, not the canonical `main` working tree or its synchronized `cvf-next` mirror
8. roots explicitly held `freeze in place` remain out of scope unless a separate preservation override packet reopens them

## Current Phase-Gate Status

- `P0`: `CLOSED`
- `P1`: `CLOSED`
- `P2`: `CLOSED`

Machine-readable source of truth:

- `governance/compat/CVF_PREPUBLIC_PHASE_GATE_REGISTRY.json`

## Root File Exposure Status

Root-level files are now separately classified from root directories.

Machine-readable source of truth:

- `governance/compat/CVF_ROOT_FILE_EXPOSURE_REGISTRY.json`

Implication:

- `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CVF_LITE.md`, `START_HERE.md`, and `CVF_ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` are treated as `PUBLIC_DOCS_ONLY`
- internal handoff, workflow scratch, and tool-facing root files remain `INTERNAL_ONLY`

## PUBLIC_DOCS_ONLY Root Audit

Current root audit posture:

- `docs`: `CURATION_REQUIRED`
- `public`: `CURATION_REQUIRED`

Meaning:

- these roots may participate in a later public docs mirror model
- they are **not** treated as “safe to mirror as-is”
- curation is still required because the current `docs/` tree contains internal-density surfaces such as incremental test logs, ADR history, and deep internal governance records

## PUBLIC_EXPORT_CANDIDATE Extension Readiness

Current readiness summary:

- `READY_FOR_EXPORT`: `0`
- `NEEDS_PACKAGING`: `13`
- `CONCEPT_ONLY`: `1`

Interpretation:

- `PUBLIC_EXPORT_CANDIDATE` means “possible candidate later”
- it does **not** mean the module is public-ready right now
- today, no extension should be treated as immediately exportable without separate packaging work

## Publication Decision Timeline

Publication decision memo:

- `docs/reference/CVF_PREPUBLIC_PUBLICATION_DECISION_MEMO_2026-04-02.md`

Current re-assessment boundary:

- `Re-assessment-By: 2026-05-01`
- or earlier if a concrete `P3` authorization proposal is drafted before that date

## Current P3 Execution Note

Executed move set:

- `P3 / CP1` retired `CVF Edit/`, `CVF_Important/`, and `CVF_Restructure/` from the visible repo root
- governing packet chain:
  - `docs/audits/archive/CVF_P3_CP1_RETIRED_REFERENCE_ROOT_RETIREMENT_AUDIT_2026-04-02.md`
  - `docs/reviews/archive/CVF_GC019_P3_CP1_RETIRED_REFERENCE_ROOT_RETIREMENT_REVIEW_2026-04-02.md`
  - `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_P3_CP1_RETIRED_REFERENCE_ROOT_RETIREMENT_DELTA_2026-04-02.md`

Current freeze-in-place roots:

- `v1.0/`
- `v1.1/`
- `REVIEW/`
- `ECOSYSTEM/`
- `CVF_SKILL_LIBRARY/`
- `ui_governance_engine/`

These roots stay where they are under the current posture. Public understanding should rely on extracted docs, not direct relocation of these paths.

## Landing Path Resolution

Status: **AUTHORIZED** — GC-039 extension packet issued 2026-04-04.

Source authority: `docs/baselines/CVF_GC039_P4_PACKAGING_LANDING_PATH_DELTA_2026-04-04.md`

| Item | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| P3/CP2 physical move (`CVF_SKILL_LIBRARY/`, `ui_governance_engine/`) | **EXCLUDED** — freeze-in-place posture maintained on canonical branches after convergence |
| P3/CP3–CP5 governance artifacts | **AUTHORIZED** to land via cherry-pick |
| P4/CP1–CP17 governance artifacts | **AUTHORIZED** to land via cherry-pick |
| P4/CP7–CP9 module export boundary changes | **AUTHORIZED** to land via cherry-pick |

Cherry-pick instructions: see `docs/baselines/CVF_GC039_P4_PACKAGING_LANDING_PATH_DELTA_2026-04-04.md`.

## Relocation Closure Notice

Status: **CLOSED-BY-DEFAULT** on the canonical branch state as of 2026-04-04.

Meaning:

- the relocation lane is no longer an active delivery priority
- `P3/CP1` is the only landed physical move set
- `P3/CP2` remains evidence only and must not be treated as pending canon work
- the closure remains in force after `main` / `cvf-next` convergence
- default next priority is master architecture completion, not more root motion

Reopen only if all of the following are explicitly true:

1. a new preservation override packet explains why path movement is safer than continued freeze-in-place retention
2. `GC-019` approves the concrete relocation scope
3. `GC-039` passes again for that concrete proposal
4. execution happens on a dedicated `restructuring/p3-*` branch
5. execution uses a secondary git worktree
6. the affected freeze-in-place roots are individually reopened in canon docs and registries before execution
7. reopened relocation work is kept off `main` and off synchronized `cvf-next` until a separate landing decision is authorized

Without that chain, agents must treat relocation as closed and out of scope.

---

## Required Next Step Before Any Further P3 Move

Before any further `P3` authorization:

- run `GC-019` structural audit/review for the proposed relocation wave
- run `GC-039` pre-public `P3` readiness guard
- confirm the target publication model that the relocation wave is trying to support
- execute on a dedicated branch matching `restructuring/p3-*`
- use a dedicated secondary worktree for that branch so relocation changes stay isolated from the canonical workspace
- exclude the current freeze-in-place root set unless a separate preservation review explicitly reopens one of them

Accelerated-close note:

- the preferred path is to avoid opening any further root-level `P3` move set
- if extracted orientation coverage and docs curation are sufficient, the restructuring lane should be treated as operationally complete for now
- master architecture completion should then regain priority

## Final Clause

Classification alone is not enough for relocation. `P3` requires explicit readiness truth.
