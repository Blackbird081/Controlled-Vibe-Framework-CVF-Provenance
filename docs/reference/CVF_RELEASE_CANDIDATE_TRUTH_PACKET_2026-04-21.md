# CVF Release Candidate Truth Packet

**Date:** 2026-04-21  
**Status:** RELEASE CANDIDATE — evidence-backed  
**Scope:** CVF core platform + provider lane + front-door product surface  

---

## Purpose

This document is the single authoritative record of what CVF has proven, what evidence exists, and what remains explicitly out of scope or unproven.

It is intended for: agent handoff, operator orientation, external reviewers, and demo preparation.

It is not marketing copy. Every claim here must be traceable to a receipt, a baseline delta, or a closed roadmap CP.

---

## Claim Boundary (verbatim — copy-paste safe)

> CVF proves governed AI-assisted software development.  
> Multi-provider operability is proven for Alibaba (qwen-turbo) and DeepSeek (deepseek-chat), both CERTIFIED by three consecutive canary runs (PASS 6/6 each).  
> Provider parity — speed, cost, quality, reliability — is not claimed.  
> Provider economics are user-selected.  
> CVF is not a production SaaS product. It is a local governance framework with a web UI for development and demonstration.

## What Is Not Proven

These items are explicitly out of scope for this release candidate. They are not gaps or failures — they are honest scope boundaries.

| Limitation | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Provider parity | Permanent boundary | Alibaba and DeepSeek pass CVF canaries. Speed, cost, quality, and reliability comparisons are not assessed by CVF. |
| Live provider credits | Permanent boundary | Keys are operator-supplied and never committed. Release-quality governance E2E requires `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`; certification canaries also consume operator credits. |
| Playwright E2E full coverage | Closed for current release gate | Mock E2E is UI-only; live governance E2E is mandatory in `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json`. |
| Legacy EXTENSIONS formal review | Open gap | Modules outside the core agent platform were not re-reviewed in W110 scope. |
| SaaS hosting / deployment | Permanent boundary | CVF is a local governance framework. There is no hosted service. |
| Token cost calibration | Open gap | Risk engine estimates token cost but does not calibrate against live provider billing data. |
| Universal model compatibility | Open gap | Only qwen-turbo and deepseek-chat have certification evidence. Other models are `EXPERIMENTAL` until canary-run. |

## How To Use This Packet

**For demo preparation:** use the claim boundary verbatim. Use the evidence pointers to answer "how do you know?" questions.

**For agent handoff:** cite this file as the milestone truth source. Do not derive milestone state from git log alone — receipts and baselines are the ground truth.

**For external sharing:** the claim boundary block is copy-paste safe. Redact any internal path that contains credentials before sharing full file.

**For future waves:** when a new milestone closes, add a row to the "What Is Proven" table and update or remove the corresponding row in "What Is Not Proven" if applicable.
