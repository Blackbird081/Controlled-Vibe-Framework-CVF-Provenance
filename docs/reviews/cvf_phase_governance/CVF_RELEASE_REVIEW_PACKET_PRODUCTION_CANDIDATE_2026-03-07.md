- mixed-family policy note: this packet evaluates the aggregated evidence set only for `production-candidate review snapshot` posture and does not imply blanket promotion of every covered runtime family
- mixed maturity posture: production-candidate families are in active review scope, while implemented-local and hardening-active families remain explicitly deferred
- deferred family note: CVF_v1.2.2_SKILL_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.8_SAFETY_HARDENING, CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY
- reviewable families: CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL, CVF_v1.6.1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM, CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME, CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB

- promotion exception note: production-candidate review posture does not promote any runtime family; reviewable families require an explicit release approval decision
- approval-eligible families: CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL, CVF_v1.6.1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM, CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME, CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB
- approval-blocked families: CVF_v1.2.2_SKILL_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.8_SAFETY_HARDENING, CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY
- approval decision note: production-candidate review posture only marks approval-eligible families for a separate explicit release approval decision; all other families remain approval-blocked
- transition-conditional families: CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL, CVF_v1.6.1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM, CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME, CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB
- transition-blocked families: CVF_v1.2.2_SKILL_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.8_SAFETY_HARDENING, CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY
- transition decision note: production-candidate review posture can only move approval-eligible families into a future promotion path after an explicit release approval decision and fresh evidence regeneration
- transition-prerequisite families: CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL, CVF_v1.6.1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM, CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME, CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB
- transition-prerequisite threshold: explicit release approval decision + fresh multi-runtime evidence regeneration
- transition prerequisite note: production-candidate review posture requires both explicit release approval and regenerated evidence before any transition-conditional family can become promotable
- transition-threshold-satisfied families: none
- transition-threshold-pending families: CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL, CVF_v1.6.1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE, CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM, CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME, CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB
- transition threshold note: production-candidate review posture keeps threshold satisfaction pending until explicit release approval and regenerated evidence are both recorded
- transition-fulfillment families: none
- transition-fulfillment artifact: none
- transition fulfillment note: production-candidate review posture does not attach transition fulfillment evidence while threshold satisfaction remains pending
- transition-approval-bound families: none

- transition-approval-artifact-required-strength: approval-strength
- transition-approval-artifact-observed-strength: none
- transition approval strength note: production-candidate review posture still requires approval-strength, but currently observes no bound approval artifact with approval-strength decision semantics

## 7. Exceptions / Overrides / Incidents

- known open risks: implemented-local families remain in the same evidence chain; publication approval is still deferred; rerun packet export after major trace changes
- approved exceptions:
  - local-only release posture before push decision
- incident or override references:
  - none recorded for this packet

## 8. Approval

- reviewer(s): local CVF authority review pending push decision
- decision: review pending
- approval date: 2026-03-07
- follow-up actions:
  - keep packet regenerated from canonical sources when trace or release state changes

## Findings

This packet reflects the canonical release/trace/baseline references at
generation time. No manual finding is asserted beyond the tabulated
sections above.

## Risk

- known open risks: implemented-local families remain in the same evidence chain; publication approval is still deferred; rerun packet export after major trace changes

## Decision

- decision: review pending

## Finding-To-Governance Learning Disposition

| Finding | Defect class | Learning lane | Disposition | Next control action | Handled or deferred |

EPISTEMIC_PROCESS_NA_WITH_REASON: this is a deterministic rendering of the named canonical references with no prediction, evidence comparison, or claim update
