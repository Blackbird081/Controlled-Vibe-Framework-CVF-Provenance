# CVF W4 Multi-Runtime Evidence Log - 2026-03-07

Memory class: FULL_RECORD

docType: review

Status: GENERATED

## Purpose

Render the current multi-runtime evidence manifest into a reviewable
Markdown log that links each runtime family's release-grade evidence.

## Target

- source manifest: `docs/reviews/cvf_phase_governance/CVF_W4_MULTI_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_2026-03-07.json`

## Scope

This log covers exactly the runtime family entries present in the
source manifest above; it makes no claim about entries outside it.

## Release Metadata

- releaseLinesCovered: `active, local-ready, stable`
- maturityBandsCovered: `hardening-active, implemented-local, production-candidate`

## Notes

- This manifest links the current release-evidence baseline across more than one runtime family.
- The `CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL` artifact proves integrity verification, pipeline execution, and phase-audit evidence can join the same release-grade manifest chain.
- The `CVF_v1.2.2_SKILL_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE` artifact proves skill filtering, phase gating, and successor-migration evidence can join the same release-grade manifest chain.
- The `CVF_v1.6.1_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE` artifact proves policy evaluation, enforcement routing, and approval-state evidence can join the same release-grade manifest chain.
- The `CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM` artifact proves governance snapshot and enforcement-route evidence can join the release-grade manifest chain.
- The `CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY` artifact remains the primary orchestration-line remediation baseline.
- The `CVF_v1.8_SAFETY_HARDENING` artifact proves rollback/recovery evidence can join the same release-facing manifest chain.
- The `CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB` artifact proves the adapter-hub line can emit compatible remediation evidence without format translation.
- The `CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME` artifact proves checkpoint/session/audit evidence can be exported into the same release-grade manifest without lossy translation.

## Findings

This log reflects 8 runtime family entries and
27 total receipts at generation time. No manual
finding is asserted beyond the tabulated manifest data above.

## Risk

No risk is asserted by this generated log; it is a deterministic
rendering of the source manifest.

## Decision

N/A with reason: this is a generated evidence log, not a decision record.

## Finding-To-Governance Learning Disposition

| Finding | Defect class | Learning lane | Disposition | Next control action | Handled or deferred |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N/A with reason: this generated log states only tabulated manifest data with no asserted defect | RUNTIME_SIGNAL_GAP | DOCUMENTATION_ONLY_LEARNING | N/A_WITH_REASON | none | N/A |

EPISTEMIC_PROCESS_NA_WITH_REASON: this is a deterministic rendering of the named source manifest with no prediction, evidence comparison, or claim update

## Claim Boundary

This log is a deterministic rendering of the named source manifest only.
It makes no provider, production, public, scale, certification, or
user-value claim.
