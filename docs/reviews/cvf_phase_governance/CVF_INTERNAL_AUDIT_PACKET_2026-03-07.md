## 7. Exceptions / Overrides / Incidents

- known open risks: implemented-local families remain in the same evidence chain; manual audit review still required before any publication decision
- approved exceptions:
  - local-only release posture before push decision
- incident or override references:
  - none recorded for this packet

## 8. Approval

- reviewer(s): local CVF authority review pending push decision
- decision: audit ready
- approval date: 2026-03-07
- follow-up actions:
  - keep packet regenerated from canonical sources when trace or release state changes

## Findings

This packet reflects the canonical release/trace/baseline references at
generation time. No manual finding is asserted beyond the tabulated
sections above.

## Risk

- known open risks: implemented-local families remain in the same evidence chain; manual audit review still required before any publication decision

## Decision

- decision: audit ready

## Finding-To-Governance Learning Disposition
