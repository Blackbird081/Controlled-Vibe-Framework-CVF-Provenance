## 1. Tranche Summary

W66-T1 CP1 delivers the **Corpus and Rubric Freeze** for the CVF Product Value Validation Wave. This is the prerequisite step before any comparative run can begin.

| Corpus A — FAM-002 (Healthcare) | 10 tasks | 10 (A2-001 – A2-010) | ✅ |

### 2.2 Task Class Distribution Per Family (Corpus A)

Each Corpus A family must have: 2 NORMAL + 2 AMBIGUOUS + 2 HIGH_RISK + 2 ADVERSARIAL + 2 MULTI_STEP

| Family | NORMAL | AMBIGUOUS | HIGH_RISK | ADVERSARIAL | MULTI_STEP |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| FAM-001 FinTech | A1-001, A1-002 ✅ | A1-003, A1-004 ✅ | A1-005, A1-006 ✅ | A1-007, A1-008 ✅ | A1-009, A1-010 ✅ |
| FAM-002 Healthcare | A2-001, A2-002 ✅ | A2-003, A2-004 ✅ | A2-005, A2-006 ✅ | A2-007, A2-008 ✅ | A2-009, A2-010 ✅ |
| FAM-003 E-Commerce | A3-001, A3-002 ✅ | A3-003, A3-004 ✅ | A3-005, A3-006 ✅ | A3-007, A3-008 ✅ | A3-009, A3-010 ✅ |
| FAM-004 Code Review | A4-001, A4-002 ✅ | A4-003, A4-004 ✅ | A4-005, A4-006 ✅ | A4-007, A4-008 ✅ | A4-009, A4-010 ✅ |
| FAM-005 SaaS CS | A5-001, A5-002 ✅ | A5-003, A5-004 ✅ | A5-005, A5-006 ✅ | A5-007, A5-008 ✅ | A5-009, A5-010 ✅ |

All distribution requirements satisfied.

### 2.3 Corpus Coverage Checklist

- [x] At least `5` scenario families present — **5** (FAM-001 through FAM-005)
- [x] At least `90` total frozen tasks present — **90**
- [x] Every Corpus A family has 2 normal + 2 ambiguous + 2 high-risk + 2 adversarial + 2 multi-step
- [x] Governance-stress tasks explicitly included — Corpus C, **20** tasks
- [x] Real product or near-real tasks explicitly included — Corpus B, **20** tasks
- [x] High-risk tasks marked for double review — all tasks with `CRITICAL` safety sensitivity use `DOUBLE_REVIEW_REQUIRED`
- [x] Every task has a stable TASK-ID within the defined namespace
- [x] Every task states whether code execution is required / not required / unknown — all tasks state `should_code_execution_be_required: NO` for the current corpus (a valid and expected finding given the governance-workflow nature of the tasks)

---

## 3. Rubric Verification

### 3.1 Required Sections Present

| Section | Required | Present | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reviewer protocol (blinding, double-review threshold, disagreement) | YES | §1 | ✅ |
| Outcome quality scoring (0–3 per dimension) | YES | §2 | ✅ |
| Governance value scoring (PASS/WARNING/FAIL) | YES | §3 | ✅ |
| Rework classification | YES | §4 | ✅ |
| Failure taxonomy | YES | §5 | ✅ |
| High-risk task override rules | YES | §6 | ✅ |
| Catastrophic miss definition | YES | §7 | ✅ |
| Run-level verdict template | YES | §8 | ✅ |
| Task-level aggregation rules | YES | §9 | ✅ |
| Hard rubric rules | YES | §10 | ✅ |
| Comparative analysis rules | YES | §11 | ✅ |
| Evidence ledger | YES | §12 | ✅ |

All required sections present.

### 3.2 Rubric Quality Checks

- [x] Scoring uses explicit evidence criteria, not vibe-based judgment
- [x] Catastrophic miss definition is specific and enumerable
- [x] Reviewer blinding protocol specified
- [x] Disagreement escalation procedure defined
- [x] High-risk override rule prevents quality score from hiding governance failure
- [x] Anti-vanity: single composite score is not the decision basis (5 quality dimensions + 4 governance dimensions independently gated)

---

## 4. Run Manifest Verification

### 4.1 Pre-Run Freeze Checklist Status

- [x] Corpus frozen — YES
- [x] Rubric frozen — YES
- [ ] Compared configurations frozen — PENDING (correct for CP1; will be completed at CP2)
- [ ] Reviewer pool assigned — PENDING (correct for CP1)
- [ ] Evidence retention path declared — PENDING (correct for CP1)

**Assessment**: All items that can be completed at CP1 are complete. The 3 PENDING items are correctly deferred to CP2 authorization — this is consistent with the GC-042 two-step structure (corpus+rubric freeze at CP1, run harness at CP2).

### 4.2 Minimum Run Count Confirmed

- 90 tasks × 2 configurations × 3 runs = **540 minimum runs** — correctly stated in the manifest

---

## 5. GC-042 Evidence Chain Verification

| Chain element | Required | Delivered at CP1 | Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frozen corpus packet | YES | YES | `CVF_PRODUCT_VALUE_VALIDATION_CORPUS_INDEX_W66_T1_CP1_*` + 4 corpus files |
| Frozen rubric packet | YES | YES | `CVF_PRODUCT_VALUE_VALIDATION_RUBRIC_W66_T1_CP1_*` |
| Governed run manifest | YES | YES (PLANNED state) | `CVF_PRODUCT_VALUE_VALIDATION_RUN_MANIFEST_W66_T1_CP2_*` |
| Final governed assessment | NO (CP5, future) | PENDING | To be created at CP5 |

**Assessment**: GC-042 chain foundation is correctly established at CP1. The assessment remains pending until CP3-CP5 complete. This is the correct posture — the chain cannot be completed without actual run data.

---

## 6. Anti-Vanity Rule Compliance

- [x] Corpus designed to include difficult and failure-prone tasks — Corpus C contains 20 adversarial/stress tasks
- [x] Corpus designed to be falsifiable — includes tasks where CVF may underperform (C-001 through C-020 are designed to test governance boundaries)
- [x] Value will be measured comparatively (CFG-A baseline required)
- [x] Human-reviewed scoring required — rubric §1 specifies blinded human review as primary
- [x] No single composite score as decision basis — Gate A/B/C/D breakdown required
- [x] Hard tasks cannot be removed after results — stated in both corpus index and rubric
- [x] Catastrophic misses remain visible permanently — stated in rubric §7 and §10

All anti-vanity rules satisfied in the corpus and rubric design.

---

## 7. Follow-Up Findings

No follow-up findings from this review. This is a DOCUMENTATION-class tranche. No code, contracts, or implementations were changed. No remediation required.

**W66-T1 Follow-Up Findings — None (DOCUMENTATION / VALIDATION_TEST class, no implementation changes)**

---

## 8. Verdict

**W66-T1 CP1: CLOSED DELIVERED**

Rationale:
- All 8 deliverables present and verified
- Corpus: 90 tasks across 5 families + Corpus B (20 real) + Corpus C (20 stress) — meets minimum
- Rubric: all required sections present; all GC-042 quality criteria satisfied
- Run manifest: correctly structured in PLANNED state for CP2 authorization
- GC-042 evidence chain foundation established
- Zero test delta; zero code delta
- Anti-vanity rules satisfied in corpus and rubric design
- No outstanding blockers

---

## 9. Next Actions

1. **CP2 authorization**: Open a fresh GC-018 for W66-T1 CP2 (Run Harness) when:
   - Execution infrastructure is confirmed (CVF API access, trace capture, storage)
   - Reviewer pool is confirmed (minimum 3 reviewers)
   - Model versions for CFG-A and CFG-B are specified
2. **Reviewer calibration**: Schedule calibration session before CP3 runs begin
3. **Human freeze confirmation**: A human reviewer must confirm the corpus and rubric freeze before CP3 runs start — the agent-authored freeze at CP1 is a prerequisite, not a final authorization for scored runs
