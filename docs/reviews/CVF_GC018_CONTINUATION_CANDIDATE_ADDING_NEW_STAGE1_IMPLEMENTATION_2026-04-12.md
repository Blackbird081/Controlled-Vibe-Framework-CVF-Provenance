## GC-018 Continuation Candidate

```text
GC-018 Continuation Candidate
- Candidate ID: GC018-ADDING-NEW-STAGE1-IMPLEMENTATION
- Date: 2026-04-12
- Parent roadmap / wave: docs/assessments/CVF_ADDING_NEW_IMPLEMENTATION_FOLLOWUP_2026-04-12.md
- Proposed scope: Bounded Stage 1 helper implementation for the promoted `CVF ADDING NEW`
  design uplift. Authorized work, if later opened, is limited to:
    - external asset intake/profile validation helpers
    - planner-trigger audit output shape
    - provisional signal capture for `weak_trigger_definition`
  The tranche must remain additive, provider-agnostic, and non-invasive.
- Continuation class: REALIZATION
- Active quality assessment: docs/assessments/archive/CVF_ADDING_NEW_STAGE1_IMPLEMENTATION_READINESS_2026-04-12.md
- Assessment date: 2026-04-12
- Weighted total: 8.4/10
- Lowest dimension: Active-path separation (7/10)
- Quality-first decision: EXPAND_NOW
- Why expansion is still the better move now:
    The design uplift is already promoted into canonical internal design drafts.
    Stage 1 is intentionally narrow and improves how upcoming live-run evidence
    can be interpreted. The tranche does not require provider-specific changes,
    new runtime pathways, or TruthScore coupling.
- Quality protection commitments:
    1. No edits to PVV corpus, rubric, lane manifest, run manifest, or batch evidence.
    2. No changes to `/api/execute` or any active provider route.
    3. No provider-specific logic in this tranche.
    4. No TruthScore deltas, fixed evaluation weights, or runtime-authorization bypass.
    5. Tests must stay targeted to touched helper surfaces only.
- Remediation target if not expanding: not applicable
- Why now:
    The operator explicitly authorized the bounded helper tranche on 2026-04-12.
    The tranche remains additive, provider-agnostic, and isolated from active
    PVV/provider execution surfaces, so it can proceed now without waiting for
    the full runtime-evidence wave to close.
- Active-path impact: LIMITED
- Risk if deferred:
    Upcoming PVV/provider evidence may be harder to interpret because planner/intake
    helper surfaces are not yet formalized in code. However, this risk is diagnostic,
    not operational.
- Lateral alternative considered: YES
- Why not lateral shift:
    Waiting until the entire PVV/provider wave is fully complete would avoid all
    overlap, but it would also delay a already-bounded tranche that can be judged
    safely once the first runtime readout clarifies concurrency appetite.
- Real decision boundary improved: YES
- Expected enforcement class:
  - CI_REPO_GATE
  - GOVERNANCE_DECISION_GATE
- Required evidence if approved:
  - bounded implementation plan naming touched files and explicit non-touch PVV surfaces
  - targeted tests for the new helper surfaces
  - closure review confirming no provider/runtime route drift

Depth Audit
- Risk reduction: 1
- Decision value: 2
- Machine enforceability: 2
- Operational efficiency: 1
- Portfolio priority: 2
- Total: 8
- Decision: CONTINUE
- Reason: The tranche is small, enforceable, and useful, but timing should remain
  disciplined because the PVV/provider evidence stream is the current live priority.

Authorization Boundary
- Authorized now: YES
- If YES, next batch name: W67-T1 CP1 - CVF ADDING NEW Stage 1 Helper Implementation
- Scope of authorized execution:
  - CPF helper contracts for external asset intake validation and planner-trigger heuristics
  - LPF helper contract for provisional `weak_trigger_definition` capture
  - targeted typecheck and targeted tests only
- Active non-overlap rule:
  - no edits to PVV/provider corpus, manifests, evidence, routes, adapters, or live lane behavior

## Human Reading Notes

This packet was prepared ahead of time and then activated by explicit operator direction on `2026-04-12`.

Its job is to make the next decision faster and safer by ensuring that:

- the tranche is already scoped
- the non-overlap rules are already written down
- other agents do not mistake the `CVF ADDING NEW` uplift for provider/runtime lane work

## Explicitly Out Of Scope

- any modification to active PVV/provider test artifacts
- any provider-lane comparison logic
- any route, adapter, or model invocation change
- any workspace/state structural adoption
- any TruthScore calibration
- any direct execution fast path outside governed plan/build/check flow
