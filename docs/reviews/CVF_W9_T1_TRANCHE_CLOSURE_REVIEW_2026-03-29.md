### Final test state

| Module | Tests | Failures |
|---|---|---|
| CPF (Control Plane Foundation) | **2110** | **0** |

**Total**: 2110 tests, 0 failures (+83 from W9-T1: CP1 +59, CP2 +24)

## Delivered Output

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| RAG/context surface classification (27 surfaces) | DELIVERED — 25 FIXED_INPUT + 2 IN_SCOPE |
| RAG retrieval authority declaration | DELIVERED — canonical ordered path KnowledgeQueryContract → KnowledgeRankingContract → RetrievalContract → ContextPackagerContract |
| Deterministic context packaging API | DELIVERED — pack() → packageHash → packageId declared canonical; frozen seeds w1-t12-cp2-context-packager / w1-t12-cp2-package-id |
| W8-T1 gateway freeze alignment | DELIVERED — model-gateway-boundary classified FIXED_INPUT; no W8-T1 surface re-opened |
| Convergence report batch aggregation | DELIVERED — dominantSurfaceCount, totalFixedInputCount, totalInScopeCount with deterministic hash |

---

## Pass Conditions (final verification)

| Condition | Final Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — RagContextEngineConvergenceContract committed and tests pass | SATISFIED — 59 tests added; 0 failures |
| 2 — At least 25 surfaces classified FIXED_INPUT | SATISFIED — 25 FIXED_INPUT surfaces confirmed |
| 3 — rag-retrieval-authority declared IN_SCOPE | SATISFIED — declared with canonical 4-contract retrieval path |
| 4 — context-packaging-deterministic-api declared IN_SCOPE | SATISFIED — pack() API declared canonical with frozen seeds |
| 5 — W8-T1 model-gateway-boundary classified FIXED_INPUT | SATISFIED — gateway freeze intact; no W8-T1 surface re-opened |
| 6 — No existing contract structurally modified | SATISFIED — additive contracts only |
| 7 — W7 chain non-destabilization verified | SATISFIED — READ_ONLY + ADDITIVE only; no STRUCTURAL impacts |

---

## Gateway Boundary Verification

- W8-T1 outputs consumed as FIXED_INPUT throughout W9-T1: ✓
- `model-gateway-boundary` classified FIXED_INPUT in `classifyRagContextSurfaces()`: ✓
- No gateway authority re-scoped or re-opened: ✓
- Pass condition 5 from GC-018 packet: SATISFIED

---

## Next Wave

- W8-T1: CLOSED DELIVERED
- W8-T2: CLOSED DELIVERED
- W9-T1: CLOSED DELIVERED
- Active tranche after this closure: NONE
- Default next governed move: fresh `GC-018` for next candidate (P5 Candidate D entry condition: P3 and P4 in motion or closed — both now closed)
