## Architecture Impact

### Consumer Visibility Gap Closed

**Before W2-T25**:
- `CommandRuntimeContract` execution results not consumer-visible
- Runtime execution counts (executed/sandboxed/skipped/failed) internal only

**After W2-T25**:
- `CommandRuntimeConsumerPipelineContract` exposes runtime results via CPF pipeline
- Runtime execution counts consumer-visible
- Batch aggregation available via `CommandRuntimeConsumerPipelineBatchContract`

**Impact**: First EPF core runtime consumer bridge delivered

### Chain Integrity

```
PolicyGateResult
  → CommandRuntimeContract (EPF core)
  → CommandRuntimeResult
  → ControlPlaneConsumerPipelineContract (CPF)
  → ControlPlaneConsumerPackage
  → CommandRuntimeConsumerPipelineResult (consumer-visible)
```

**Assessment**: ✅ Chain integrity maintained, no data loss

---

## Test Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Baseline | 902 tests |
| CP1 delta | +39 tests |
| CP2 delta | +25 tests |
| Total delta | +64 tests |
| Final count | 966 tests |
| Failures | 0 |

**Test Coverage**:
- CP1: instantiation, output shape, consumerId, hashing, query derivation, warnings, runtime propagation, consumer package, mixed decisions
- CP2: instantiation, output shape, empty batch, single result, multiple results, hashing, mixed counts

**Assessment**: ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Tranche Closure Decision

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED FOR CLOSURE

**Rationale**:
1. All control points complete (CP1, CP2, CP3)
2. All governance requirements met (GC-018, GC-019, GC-021, GC-022, GC-024, GC-026)
3. All tests pass (966 EPF tests, 0 failures)
4. All deliverables complete
5. Success criteria met
6. No outstanding issues

**Authorization**: GRANTED

**Next Steps**:
1. Create GC-026 closure sync
2. Update progress tracker
3. Update handoff document
4. Commit closure artifacts
5. Push to cvf-next

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Query derivation**: 120 char limit from summary text works well
2. **contextId assignment**: runtimeId provides correct context linkage
3. **Warning logic**: failedCount and sandboxedCount provide clear signals
4. **Batch aggregation**: max for tokens, sum for counts follows established pattern
5. **Test count**: 64 tests (39 + 25) aligns with established consumer bridge pattern
