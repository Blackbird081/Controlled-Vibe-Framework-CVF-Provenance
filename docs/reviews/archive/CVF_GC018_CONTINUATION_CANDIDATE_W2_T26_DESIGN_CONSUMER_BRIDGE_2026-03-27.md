GC-018 Continuation Candidate
- Candidate ID: W2-T26
- Date: 2026-03-27
- Parent roadmap / wave: docs/roadmaps/CVF_WHITEPAPER_COMPLETION_ROADMAP_2026-03-21.md
- Proposed scope: close the CPF design-orchestration visibility gap for `DesignContract` with one consumer bridge tranche
- Continuation class: REALIZATION
- Why now: `DesignContract` is the highest-value unbridged orchestration artifact discovered in the post-W1-T25 survey and carries task breakdown, risk, phase, and role assignment signals across planes
- Active-path impact: LIMITED
- Risk if deferred: design plans remain trapped inside orchestration without a governed consumer-visible path, weakening cross-plane planning transparency and reuse
- Lateral alternative considered: YES
- Why not lateral shift: other remaining CPF gaps existed, but `DesignContract` is the strongest cross-plane planning surface and closes a more consequential orchestration boundary than another lateral gateway-only move
- Real decision boundary improved: YES
- Expected enforcement class:
  - APPROVAL_CHECKPOINT
- Required evidence if approved:
  - CP1 audit/review/delta plus dedicated CPF consumer-pipeline tests
  - CP2 batch audit/review/delta plus tracker sync and closure packet

Depth Audit
- Risk reduction: 2
- Decision value: 2
- Machine enforceability: 2
- Operational efficiency: 2
- Portfolio priority: 2
- Total: 10
- Decision: CONTINUE
- Reason: W2-T26 exposes the CPF design plan as a governed consumer artifact and closes a cross-plane planning boundary that materially improves downstream execution and review decisions.

Authorization Boundary
- Authorized now: YES
- If YES, next batch name: W2-T26 — Design Consumer Pipeline Bridge
- If NO, reopen trigger: fresh GC-018 candidate

## Survey Context

Following W1-T25 completion (third CPF log consumer bridge), performed fresh GC-018 survey to identify next highest-value unbridged contract. Surveyed CPF, EPF, and GEF for unbridged contracts.

---

## Survey Methodology

1. Verified all CPF log contracts are bridged (GatewayAuthLog, GatewayPIIDetectionLog, RouteMatchLog)
2. Searched EPF for log contracts (none found - EPF uses different patterns)
3. Searched GEF for log contracts (all already bridged)
4. Surveyed CPF for non-log contracts without consumer bridges
5. Identified `DesignContract` as high-value unbridged contract

---

## Candidate Identification

**Contract**: `DesignContract` (W1-T3 CP1)
**Location**: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/src/design.contract.ts`
**Status**: Unbridged (no consumer pipeline visibility)

**Purpose**: Creates design plans with task breakdowns, agent role assignments, risk assessments, and phase organization for control plane orchestration

**Current observability gap**: Design plans exist but cannot be consumed by downstream pipelines with context packaging and knowledge ranking integration

---

## Architectural Value Assessment

### High-Value Indicators

1. **Core orchestration visibility**: Design plans are fundamental to control plane task orchestration
2. **Cross-plane coordination**: Design plans coordinate work across control, execution, governance, and learning planes
3. **Risk-aware planning**: Design contract includes risk assessment (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) for each task
4. **Agent role mapping**: Design plans specify which agent roles (DESIGNER, EXECUTOR, REVIEWER, AUDITOR) handle each task
5. **Phase organization**: Design plans organize tasks into phases (PLANNING, DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION, VALIDATION, CLOSURE)

### Architectural Fit

- **Plane**: Control Plane Foundation (CPF)
- **Layer**: Orchestration layer
- **Integration**: Bridges into existing `ControlPlaneConsumerPipelineContract`
- **Dependencies**: `DesignContract`, `ControlPlaneConsumerPipelineContract`, `KnowledgeRankingContract`, `ContextPackagerContract`

---

## Proposed Tranche Scope

### W2-T26 — Design Consumer Pipeline Bridge

**CP1 (Full Lane)**: `DesignConsumerPipelineContract`
- Bridges `DesignContract` into CPF consumer pipeline
- Query format: `"DesignPlan: {totalTasks} tasks, phase={dominantPhase}, risk={dominantRisk}"`
- contextId: `designPlan.planId`
- Warnings: `NO_TASKS` (totalTasks === 0), `HIGH_RISK_TASKS` (criticalRiskCount > 0)
- Expected tests: ~30

**CP2 (Fast Lane GC-021)**: `DesignConsumerPipelineBatchContract`
- Aggregates multiple `DesignConsumerPipelineResult` records
- Aggregation: frequency-based dominant phase and risk level
- dominantTokenBudget = max(estimatedTokens)
- Expected tests: ~25

**CP3 (Closure)**: Tranche closure artifacts

**Expected test delta**: CPF 1189 → ~1245 (+~56 tests)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Query format complexity | Low | Low | Follow established pattern from W1-T23/W1-T24/W1-T25 |
| Warning threshold tuning | Low | Low | Use presence of CRITICAL risk tasks as high-risk indicator |
| Dominant phase/risk tie-breaking | Low | Low | Frequency-first, then priority-based (CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW for risk; CLOSURE > VALIDATION > IMPLEMENTATION > DESIGN > PLANNING for phase) |
| Test coverage gaps | Low | Low | Follow comprehensive test pattern from prior consumer bridges |

## Governance Compliance

- [x] GC-018 survey performed
- [x] Unbridged contract identified
- [x] Architectural value assessed
- [x] Tranche scope defined
- [x] Risk assessment completed
- [x] Audit score: 10/10

## Authorization Decision

**AUTHORIZED** for immediate implementation

**Rationale**:
1. Clear architectural value (orchestration visibility)
2. Consistent with established consumer bridge pattern
3. Low risk, high observability benefit
4. Enables design plan consumption across planes
5. Strengthens CPF orchestration layer

---

## Next Steps

1. Create execution plan (`docs/roadmaps/CVF_W2_T26_DESIGN_CONSUMER_BRIDGE_EXECUTION_PLAN_2026-03-27.md`)
2. Create GC-026 authorization sync (`docs/baselines/archive/CVF_GC026_TRACKER_SYNC_W2_T26_AUTHORIZATION_2026-03-27.md`)
3. Implement CP1 (Full Lane)
4. Implement CP2 (Fast Lane GC-021)
5. Execute CP3 (Closure)

## Audit Score: 10/10

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Architectural fit | 10/10 | Perfect fit for CPF consumer bridge expansion |
| Value proposition | 10/10 | High observability value for orchestration |
| Risk profile | 10/10 | Low risk, established pattern |
| Scope clarity | 10/10 | Clear CP1/CP2/CP3 structure |
| Governance alignment | 10/10 | Full GC-018/GC-021/GC-022/GC-024/GC-026 compliance |

**Overall**: 10/10 — AUTHORIZED
