GC-018 Continuation Candidate
- Candidate ID: W1-T29
- Date: 2026-03-27
- Parent roadmap / wave: docs/roadmaps/CVF_WHITEPAPER_COMPLETION_ROADMAP_2026-03-21.md
- Proposed scope: close the CPF intake classification visibility gap for `IntakeContract` with one consumer bridge tranche
- Continuation class: REALIZATION
- Why now: `IntakeContract` is the canonical control-plane entry contract after gateway processing and is the highest-value remaining aggregate for domain classification, task extraction, and risk summarization
- Active-path impact: LIMITED
- Risk if deferred: intake domain detection, task planning, and risk summaries remain unavailable to governed consumer packaging, leaving the CPF intake decision boundary opaque downstream
- Lateral alternative considered: YES
- Why not lateral shift: `RouteMatchContract` is important but narrower; `IntakeContract` is the more decisive classification and task-shaping boundary immediately after gateway handling
- Real decision boundary improved: YES
- Expected enforcement class:
  - APPROVAL_CHECKPOINT
- Required evidence if approved:
  - CP1 audit/review/delta plus dedicated CPF consumer-pipeline tests
  - CP2 batch audit/review/delta plus tracker sync and closure packet

Depth Audit
- Risk reduction: 2
- Decision value: 2
- Machine enforceability: 2
- Operational efficiency: 2
- Portfolio priority: 2
- Total: 10
- Decision: CONTINUE
- Reason: W1-T29 closes the CPF intake decision boundary by making domain, task, and risk extraction consumer-visible and reviewable across downstream governed flows.

Authorization Boundary
- Authorized now: YES
- If YES, next batch name: W1-T29 — Intake Consumer Pipeline Bridge
- If NO, reopen trigger: fresh GC-018 candidate

## Survey Context

Following W1-T28 closure (AI Gateway Consumer Pipeline Bridge), this GC-018 survey identifies the next highest-value unbridged contract in CPF for consumer pipeline visibility.

---

## CPF Consumer Bridge Status

### Bridged Contracts (6 total)
1. `GatewayAuthLogContract` → `GatewayAuthLogConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T23)
2. `GatewayPIIDetectionLogContract` → `GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T24)
3. `RouteMatchLogContract` → `RouteMatchLogConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T25)
4. `DesignContract` → `DesignConsumerPipelineContract` (W2-T26)
5. `BoardroomContract` → `BoardroomConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T27)
6. `AIGatewayContract` → `AIGatewayConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T28)

### Unbridged Contracts Analysis

| Contract | Has Consumer Bridge? | Priority | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| `IntakeContract` | ❌ NO | HIGH | Control plane entry point, processes all incoming signals with domain detection and task extraction |
| `RouteMatchContract` | ❌ NO | MEDIUM | Routing logic, but log contract already bridged |
| `OrchestrationContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T15) |
| `ReversePromptingContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T17) |
| `ClarificationRefinementContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T21) |
| `KnowledgeQueryContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T22) |
| `KnowledgeRankingContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T19) |
| `GatewayAuthContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T20) |
| `GatewayPIIDetectionContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T18) |
| `BoardroomRoundContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Sub-component of BoardroomContract |
| `BoardroomMultiRoundContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Sub-component of BoardroomContract |
| `BoardroomTransitionGateContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Sub-component of BoardroomContract |
| `ContextBuildContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal context building, less consumer-facing |
| `ContextPackagerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal context packaging, less consumer-facing |
| `ContextEnrichmentContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal context enrichment, less consumer-facing |
| `RetrievalContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal retrieval, less consumer-facing |
| `PackagingContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal packaging, less consumer-facing |
| `ConsumerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Base consumer contract, not domain-specific |
| `GatewayConsumerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal gateway consumption, less consumer-facing |
| `DesignConsumerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal design consumption, less consumer-facing |

## Recommended Candidate: IntakeContract

### Contract Overview
- **Source**: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/src/intake.contract.ts`
- **Purpose**: Control plane entry point for all incoming signals with domain detection, task extraction, and risk assessment
- **Key data**: ControlPlaneIntakeResult, IntakePackagedContext, domain detection, task count, risk summary
- **Consumer value**: HIGH — exposes intake processing, domain classification, and task planning

### Bridging Rationale
1. **High consumer value**: IntakeContract is the control plane entry point for all signals
2. **Rich intake context**: ControlPlaneIntakeResult contains domain detection, task extraction, and risk assessment
3. **Domain visibility**: Enables consumers to track domain classification and task planning
4. **Task tracking**: Exposes task count and risk summary for intake analysis
5. **Governance alignment**: Intake processing requires consumer-visible audit trails

### Expected Consumer Pipeline Contract

**Contract name**: `IntakeConsumerPipelineContract`

**Input**: `IntakeConsumerPipelineRequest`
- `intakeResult: ControlPlaneIntakeResult` (from IntakeContract)
- `candidateItems?: RankableKnowledgeItem[]`
- `scoringWeights?: ScoringWeights`
- `segmentTypeConstraints?: SegmentTypeConstraints`
- `consumerId?: string`

**Output**: `IntakeConsumerPipelineResult`
- `resultId: string`
- `createdAt: string`
- `intakeResult: ControlPlaneIntakeResult`
- `consumerPackage: ControlPlaneConsumerPackage`
- `query: string`
- `contextId: string`
- `warnings: string[]`
- `consumerId: string | undefined`
- `pipelineHash: string`

**Query format**: `"Intake: domain={domain}, tasks={taskCount}, risk={dominantRisk}"`

**contextId**: `intakeResult.intakeId`

**Warnings**:
- `WARNING_NO_DOMAIN`: domainDetected === "unknown" or empty
- `WARNING_NO_TASKS`: totalTasks === 0

**Aggregation fields** (for batch contract):
- `totalIntakes: number`
- `overallDominantDomain: string` (frequency-based)
- `totalTasks: number`
- `overallDominantRisk: string` (frequency-based: R3 > R2 > R1 > R0)
- `dominantTokenBudget: number`
