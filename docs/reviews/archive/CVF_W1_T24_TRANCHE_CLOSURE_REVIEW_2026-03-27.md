## Tranche Summary

W1-T24 delivers consumer pipeline visibility for `GatewayPIIDetectionLogContract`, completing the second CPF log consumer bridge. This tranche bridges PII detection log data into the CPF consumer pipeline, enabling downstream consumers to query and aggregate PII detection metrics with full context packaging and knowledge ranking integration.

---

## Control Point Delivery

### CP1 — GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineContract (Full Lane)

**Contract**: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/src/gateway.pii.detection.log.consumer.pipeline.contract.ts`

**Purpose**: Bridges `GatewayPIIDetectionLogContract` into CPF consumer pipeline

**Query format**: `"PIIDetectionLog: {totalScanned} scanned, detected={piiDetectedCount}, type={dominantPIIType}"`

**contextId**: `log.logId`

**Warnings**:
- `WARNING_NO_SCANS`: totalScanned === 0
- `WARNING_HIGH_PII_RATE`: piiDetectedCount / totalScanned > 0.5

**Tests**: 36 new tests covering instantiation, output shape, deterministic hashing, query derivation, contextId, warnings, dominantPIIType propagation, and log propagation

**Governance**: Full Lane audit + review + delta + execution plan update

---

### CP2 — GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineBatchContract (Fast Lane GC-021)

**Contract**: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/src/gateway.pii.detection.log.consumer.pipeline.batch.contract.ts`

**Purpose**: Aggregates multiple `GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineResult` records into a batch

**Aggregation logic**:
- `totalLogs` = count of results
- `totalScanned` = sum(result.log.totalScanned)
- `overallDominantPIIType` = most frequent PII type across all logs (severity-based tie-break: SSN > CREDIT_CARD > EMAIL > PHONE > CUSTOM)
- `dominantTokenBudget` = max(result.consumerPackage.typedContextPackage.estimatedTokens)

**Tests**: 31 new tests covering instantiation, output shape, deterministic hashing, totalLogs, totalScanned, overallDominantPIIType, and dominantTokenBudget

**Governance**: Fast Lane (GC-021) audit + review + delta + execution plan update

---

### CP3 — Tranche Closure

**Artifacts**:
- Closure review (this document)
- GC-026 completion sync
- Tracker update
- Handoff update

**Test results**: CPF 1045 → 1124 tests (+79 tests, 0 failures)

**Governance compliance**: All GC-018, GC-021, GC-022, GC-024, GC-026 requirements met

## Test Coverage

| Scope | Tests | Coverage |
|-------|-------|----------|
| CP1 pipeline contract | 36 | instantiation, output shape, consumerId, deterministic hashing, query derivation, contextId, warnings, dominantPIIType, log propagation |
| CP2 batch contract | 31 | instantiation, output shape, deterministic hashing, totalLogs, totalScanned, overallDominantPIIType, dominantTokenBudget |
| Total new tests | 67 | comprehensive coverage |
| CPF total | 1124 | 1045 → 1124 (+79 including W1-T23 fix) |

Note: Total includes 67 new W1-T24 tests + 12 additional tests from W1-T23 helper fix

## Architectural Impact

### Consumer Pipeline Chain

PII detection observability chain now complete:
```
GatewayPIIDetectionContract
  → GatewayPIIDetectionLogContract
    → GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineContract (W1-T24 CP1)
      → GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineBatchContract (W1-T24 CP2)
```

### CPF Consumer Bridge Progress

- Total CPF log consumer bridges: 2 (GatewayAuthLog, GatewayPIIDetectionLog)
- Remaining unbridged CPF contracts: multiple (requires fresh GC-018 survey)

---

## Determinism Compliance

All contracts follow CVF deterministic reproducibility protocol:
- `now` dependency injection with default `() => new Date().toISOString()`
- `now` threaded to all inner contracts via constructor dependencies
- All IDs computed via `computeDeterministicHash()` from CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY
- Batch contracts follow canonical pattern: `batchId = hash(batchHash)`, `batchHash = hash(aggregation + timestamp)`

---

## Memory Governance (GC-022)

All artifacts classified per GC-022:
- Audits, reviews: `FULL_RECORD`
- Baselines, roadmaps: `SUMMARY_RECORD`
- Reference docs: `POINTER_RECORD`

---

## Test Governance (GC-024)

- Dedicated test file: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/tests/gateway.pii.detection.log.consumer.pipeline.test.ts`
- Test partition registry updated with W1-T24 CP1 and CP2 entries
- No tests added to `tests/index.test.ts` (partition isolation maintained)

---

## Closure Checklist

- [x] CP1 contract implemented and tested (36 tests)
- [x] CP2 batch contract implemented and tested (31 tests)
- [x] Barrel exports updated (`src/index.ts`)
- [x] Test partition registry updated
- [x] All tests passing (1124 CPF tests, 0 failures)
- [x] CP1+CP2 committed and pushed to cvf-next
- [x] Closure review created (this document)
- [x] GC-026 completion sync created
- [x] Tracker updated
- [x] Handoff updated

---

## Next Steps

W1-T24 is now canonically closed. Any future CPF consumer bridge work requires:
1. Fresh GC-018 survey to identify next highest-value unbridged contract
2. GC-018 authorization (10/10 audit score)
3. Execution plan
4. GC-026 authorization sync
5. CP1 Full Lane → CP2 Fast Lane → CP3 Closure
