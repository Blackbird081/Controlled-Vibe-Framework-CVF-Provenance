## Gap Closed

`PatternDriftContract` (W6-T6, LPF drift detection contract) now has a governed consumer-visible enriched output path.
- `TruthModel (baseline + current) → PatternDriftSignal` chain now consumer-visible
- **Fifth LPF consumer bridge delivered**
- Drift class visibility: CRITICAL_DRIFT / DRIFTING / STABLE — all consumer-visible with governed warnings

---

## Closure Decision

**TRANCHE CLOSED — W4-T12 DELIVERED** — 685 LPF tests, 0 failures.
Next: fresh GC-018 survey for next highest-value unbridged LPF aggregate contract (LearningObservabilityContract) or EPF aggregate contract.
