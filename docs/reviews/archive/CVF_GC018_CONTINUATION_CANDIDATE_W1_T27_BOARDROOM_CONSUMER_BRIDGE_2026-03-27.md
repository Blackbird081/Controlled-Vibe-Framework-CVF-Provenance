GC-018 Continuation Candidate
- Candidate ID: W1-T27
- Date: 2026-03-27
- Parent roadmap / wave: docs/roadmaps/CVF_WHITEPAPER_COMPLETION_ROADMAP_2026-03-21.md
- Proposed scope: close the CPF orchestration visibility gap for `BoardroomContract` with one consumer bridge tranche
- Continuation class: REALIZATION
- Why now: `BoardroomContract` is the highest-value remaining CPF orchestration aggregate after the gateway log chain and exposes multi-round decisions, clarification state, and consensus rationale that downstream consumers cannot yet see
- Active-path impact: LIMITED
- Risk if deferred: boardroom decisions remain opaque to governed consumer packaging, making orchestration consensus and clarification trails hard to audit or reuse downstream
- Lateral alternative considered: YES
- Why not lateral shift: `AIGatewayContract` and `IntakeContract` are important, but `BoardroomContract` is the decisive orchestration artifact that turns deliberation into action and therefore closes a stronger decision boundary first
- Real decision boundary improved: YES
- Expected enforcement class:
  - GOVERNANCE_DECISION_GATE
- Required evidence if approved:
  - CP1 audit/review/delta plus dedicated CPF consumer-pipeline tests
  - CP2 batch audit/review/delta plus tracker sync and closure packet

Depth Audit
- Risk reduction: 2
- Decision value: 2
- Machine enforceability: 2
- Operational efficiency: 2
- Portfolio priority: 2
- Total: 10
- Decision: CONTINUE
- Reason: W1-T27 closes the next highest-value CPF orchestration gap by making boardroom deliberation and clarification outcomes consumer-visible in a governed way.

Authorization Boundary
- Authorized now: YES
- If YES, next batch name: W1-T27 — Boardroom Consumer Pipeline Bridge
- If NO, reopen trigger: fresh GC-018 candidate

## Survey Context

Following W2-T26 closure (Design Consumer Pipeline Bridge), this GC-018 survey identifies the next highest-value unbridged contract in CPF for consumer pipeline visibility.

---

## CPF Consumer Bridge Status

### Bridged Contracts (4 total)
1. `GatewayAuthLogContract` → `GatewayAuthLogConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T23)
2. `GatewayPIIDetectionLogContract` → `GatewayPIIDetectionLogConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T24)
3. `RouteMatchLogContract` → `RouteMatchLogConsumerPipelineContract` (W1-T25)
4. `DesignContract` → `DesignConsumerPipelineContract` (W2-T26)

### Unbridged Contracts Analysis

| Contract | Has Consumer Bridge? | Priority | Rationale |
|----------|---------------------|----------|-----------|
| `BoardroomContract` | ❌ NO | HIGH | Core orchestration contract, multi-round decision-making, clarification tracking |
| `OrchestrationContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T15) |
| `ReversePromptingContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T17) |

| `GatewayPIIDetectionContract` | ✅ YES | N/A | Already bridged (W1-T18) |
| `AIGatewayContract` | ❌ NO | MEDIUM | Gateway entry point, but less granular than specific gateway contracts |
| `RouteMatchContract` | ❌ NO | MEDIUM | Routing logic, but log contract already bridged |
| `BoardroomRoundContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Sub-component of BoardroomContract |
| `BoardroomMultiRoundContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Sub-component of BoardroomContract |
| `BoardroomTransitionGateContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Sub-component of BoardroomContract |
| `ContextBuildContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal context building, less consumer-facing |
| `ContextPackagerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal context packaging, less consumer-facing |
| `ContextEnrichmentContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal context enrichment, less consumer-facing |
| `IntakeContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal intake processing, less consumer-facing |
| `RetrievalContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal retrieval, less consumer-facing |
| `PackagingContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal packaging, less consumer-facing |
| `ConsumerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Base consumer contract, not domain-specific |
| `GatewayConsumerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal gateway consumption, less consumer-facing |
| `DesignConsumerContract` | ❌ NO | LOW | Internal design consumption, less consumer-facing |

## Recommended Candidate: BoardroomContract

### Contract Overview
- **Source**: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_CONTROL_PLANE_FOUNDATION/src/boardroom.contract.ts`
- **Purpose**: Multi-round AI boardroom decision-making with clarification tracking
- **Key data**: BoardroomSession, BoardroomDecision, ClarificationEntry, ClarificationStatus
- **Consumer value**: HIGH — exposes boardroom decision-making process, clarification tracking, and multi-round consensus

### Bridging Rationale
1. **High consumer value**: Boardroom sessions are core orchestration artifacts that downstream consumers need visibility into
2. **Rich decision context**: BoardroomSession contains decision rationale, clarification entries, and consensus tracking
3. **Multi-round tracking**: Enables consumers to understand decision evolution across rounds
4. **Clarification visibility**: Exposes clarification questions and answers for transparency
5. **Governance alignment**: Boardroom decisions drive orchestration and require consumer-visible audit trails

### Expected Consumer Pipeline Contract

**Contract name**: `BoardroomConsumerPipelineContract`

**Input**: `BoardroomConsumerPipelineRequest`
- `boardroomSession: BoardroomSession` (from BoardroomContract)
- `consumerId: string`
- `consumerType: string`

**Output**: `BoardroomConsumerPipelineResult`
- `consumerId: string`
- `consumerType: string`
- `boardroomSession: BoardroomSession`
- `consumerPackage: ControlPlaneConsumerPackage` (with typed context package)
- `query: string` (derived from session)
- `contextId: string` (sessionId)
- `warnings: string[]`

**Query format**: `"BoardroomSession: {totalRounds} rounds, decision={decision}, clarifications={clarificationCount}"`

**Warnings**:
- `WARNING_NO_ROUNDS`: totalRounds === 0
- `WARNING_PENDING_CLARIFICATIONS`: clarificationStatus includes PENDING entries

**Aggregation fields** (for batch contract):
- `totalSessions: number`
- `totalRounds: number`
- `overallDominantDecision: BoardroomSessionDecision` (frequency-based: APPROVED > REJECTED > NEEDS_CLARIFICATION > PENDING)
- `totalClarifications: number`
- `dominantTokenBudget: number`
