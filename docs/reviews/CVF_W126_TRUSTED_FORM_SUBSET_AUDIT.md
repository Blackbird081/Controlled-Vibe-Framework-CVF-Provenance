# W126 Trusted Form Subset Audit

> Date: 2026-04-27
> Auditor: W126-T1 implementation session
> Status: APPROVED FOR W126 ROUTING
> Corpus size: 44 form templates (excl. 9 wizard-family)
> Trusted subset size: 8

---

## Purpose

This audit selects the trusted form-template subset eligible for intent-first routing in W126.
The selection must be explicit, bounded, and reviewable. No form may be added to the trusted
subset without a new audit entry and commit.

Inclusion criteria:
1. Noncoder-legible activation — the form's purpose is clear from plain-language input
2. Unambiguous intent signal — intent keywords map cleanly to this form, not to a wizard
3. Safe for non-coders — no dangerous operations, no legal/compliance expert requirement
4. Distinct from wizard family — wizard should not already serve this intent better

## Routing Precedence (CP2 Contract)

```
1. wizard-family route   (detectIntent suggestedTemplates.length > 0)
2. trusted form route    (routeToTrustedForm match — W126)
3. clarification loop    (weak_confidence + isClarificationEligible)
4. guided browse         (depth limit reached or ineligible)
```

Wizard always wins on collision. Form routing only activates when no wizard matched.

---

## Exclusion Permanence

The following categories are permanently excluded from W126 trusted routing:
- CVF-internal templates (`vibe_*`, `individual_skills_folder`, `project_init_checklist`)
- Legal/compliance templates (`gdpr_compliance`, `privacy_policy_audit`, `tos_review`)
- R3 operational templates (`incident_response`)
- Coder-only templates (code review, API, architecture, accessibility, CLI)
- Wizard-duplicate templates (templates whose intent is already covered by a wizard)

At W126 closure time, expansion beyond 8 forms required a new audit entry in
this file. Current corpus scope is superseded by the Post-W149 note below.

## Post-W149 Supersession Note (2026-05-08)

W126 remains the historical audit for the original 8-form trusted subset.

The current trusted-form corpus boundary is superseded by the W142-W149 chain:

- W142-W147 expanded `TRUSTED_FORM_MAP` to the 40 non-wizard form corpus.
- W149 live-proved the expanded corpus with Alibaba direct API 40/40,
  Alibaba browser UI 40/40 with governed receipts, and DeepSeek confirmatory
  12/12.
- W150-W151 split corpus/router/test ownership without changing behavior.

For current implementation scope, use:

- `docs/reviews/CVF_W149_TRUSTED_FORM_FULL_CORPUS_LOCK_2026-05-08.md`
- `docs/reviews/CVF_W149_CLOSURE_DECISION_2026-05-08.md`
- `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/lib/trusted-form-corpus.ts`

Do not use this W126 file alone as the current corpus boundary.
