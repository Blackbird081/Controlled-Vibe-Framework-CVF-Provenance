## Purpose

Lock the bounded set of deliverable pack families for W125-T1. Each pack type is
a structured artifact that combines main output, governance evidence, and next-step
handoff context into a single repeatable shape.

---

## Pack Families

### 1. App Planning Pack (`app_planning`)

**Consumer**: Technical builder, engineering team, product manager

**Handoff purpose**: Carries a non-coder's app concept through to a team that
will build it. Includes what the app should do, who it serves, governance context,
and recommended next steps for a scoped build.

**Source templates**: `app_builder_wizard`, `app-planning`, any `development` or
`product` category starter

**Pack shape**:
- Headline: App concept name / goal
- Executive summary: Problem, audience, proposed solution (2-3 sentences)
- Main output: Full governed output from CVF run
- Scope boundary: What is in/out of scope for this planning artifact
- Governance evidence: Receipt of governed AI path (decision, provider, policy snapshot)
- Recommended next actions: 3-5 builder-ready next steps
- Handoff notes: Context the builder needs that is NOT in the output itself

---

### 2. Business Decision Pack (`business_decision`)

**Consumer**: Leadership team, department heads, decision-makers

**Handoff purpose**: Turns a governed strategy or business analysis run into a
leadership-ready artifact. Includes the conclusion, supporting rationale,
evidence of responsible AI use, and a clear recommendation.

**Source templates**: `business_strategy_wizard`, `strategy_analysis`,
`market_analysis`, `business` or `marketing` category starters

**Pack shape**:
- Headline: Decision context / question being addressed
- Executive summary: Recommendation in plain language (2-3 sentences)
- Main output: Full governed output from CVF run
- Scope boundary: What this analysis covers and does not cover
- Governance evidence: Governed AI path receipt
- Recommended next actions: Leadership-level next steps (approve / escalate / investigate)
- Handoff notes: Confidence level and known limitations

---

### 3. Review / Findings Pack (`review_findings`)

**Consumer**: Reviewers, auditors, QA leads, compliance stakeholders

**Handoff purpose**: Packages a CVF-governed review or audit run as a findings
artifact that can go into a review meeting or compliance record.

**Source templates**: `security_assessment_wizard`, `code_review_wizard`,
`review_analysis`, `security` or `research` category starters

**Pack shape**:
- Headline: What was reviewed
- Executive summary: Key findings (pass / flag / concern)
- Main output: Full governed findings from CVF run
- Scope boundary: What was in scope for this review
- Governance evidence: Governed AI path receipt
- Recommended next actions: Prioritized remediation or follow-up steps
- Handoff notes: Risk level summary, items requiring human judgement

---

### 4. Documentation Handoff Pack (`documentation_handoff`)

**Consumer**: Writers, maintainers, on-boarding team, external partners

**Handoff purpose**: Wraps a governed documentation run into a transferable
artifact that a writer or maintainer can directly use or refine.

**Source templates**: `documentation_wizard`, `documentation`, `content` or
`technical` category starters

**Pack shape**:
- Headline: What is being documented
- Executive summary: Scope and audience for the documentation
- Main output: Full governed documentation from CVF run
- Scope boundary: What topics this documentation covers
- Governance evidence: Governed AI path receipt
- Recommended next actions: Review → approve → publish steps
- Handoff notes: Suggested reviewers, gaps that need human input

---

## Pack Boundaries (binding for W125-T1)

- **Max 4 pack types** in this tranche — no new types without a new GC-018
- **Evidence is embedded** in every pack, not a detached appendix
- **Pack generation** uses only existing result surfaces — no new provider calls
- **Pack type is inferred** from template/category — users are not forced to choose

---

## Excluded From This Taxonomy

- Custom/arbitrary pack templates
- External workflow integrations (Slack, Notion, Jira)
- Collaboration or commenting within the pack
- Full PDF/Word overhaul

---
