> Lane: Fast Lane (GC-021)
> Baseline: v3.7-W46T1 (CLOSURE-ASSESSED)

## 1. Authorization Request

**Request**: Authorize W65-T1 — Phase B Packaging

**Rationale**: Phase A packaging (W63-T1) prepared Guard Contract, MCP Server, and Deterministic Reproducibility for public export readiness. Phase B extends this pattern to four additional packages that have achieved architectural closure but lack packaging metadata, export boundary definitions, and publication posture documentation.

---

## 2. Proposed Scope

### 2.1 Target Packages

| Package | npm name | Status before W65-T1 |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB` | `cvf-runtime-adapter-hub` | Has exports/files/license; missing `exportReadiness` only |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_GOVERNANCE_EXPANSION_FOUNDATION` | `cvf-governance-expansion-foundation` | `private: true`; no exports/files/license; needs README update |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_LEARNING_PLANE_FOUNDATION` | `cvf-learning-plane-foundation` | `private: true`; no exports/files/license; no README |
| `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.7.1_SAFETY_RUNTIME` | `cvf-safety-runtime` | `private: true`; mixed package; heavy deps — `REVIEW_REQUIRED` |

### 2.2 Work Authorized

- Add `exportReadiness` metadata to all 4 `package.json` files
- Add `exports`, `files`, `sideEffects`, `license`, `keywords` to GEF and LPF packages
- Create README.md for LPF; update README.md for GEF
- Record export boundary notes in each package's `exportReadiness.documentation` field
- For Safety Runtime: document blockers in `exportReadiness` without removing `private: true`

### 2.3 Explicitly Out of Scope

- No new contracts, modules, or contract-level implementations
- No cross-plane boundary changes
- No removal of `private: true` for Safety Runtime (blocked by mixed deps)
- No physical publication (`npm publish`) — publication remains ungoverned until a future bounded decision
- No broad repo restructuring
- No relocation reopen

---

## 3. Exit Criteria

1. All 4 packages have `exportReadiness` metadata in `package.json`
2. GEF and LPF have `exports`, `files`, `license`, and updated/created README
3. Safety Runtime has `exportReadiness: REVIEW_REQUIRED` with documented blockers
4. Runtime Adapter Hub has `exportReadiness: CANDIDATE`
5. No internal dependency leakage introduced (production deps check)
6. Package-level `check` / `test` pass for all affected packages (inherited from baseline — no code changes)

---

## 4. Governance Compliance Check

| Protocol | Satisfied? | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| GC-018 authorization | ✅ this document | Authorizes W65-T1 |
| Bounded scope | ✅ | 4 packages, metadata only |
| Fast Lane eligibility | ✅ | No concept/module creation; additive metadata |
| Architecture baseline unchanged | ✅ | v3.7-W46T1; no expansion |
| No relocation reopen | ✅ | No file moves |
| Scan registry check | ✅ | No open surfaces affected by packaging metadata |

---

## 5. Authorization Decision

**AUTHORIZED**

W65-T1 — Phase B Packaging is authorized to proceed under Fast Lane (GC-021).

Single CP: CP1 — all 4 package targets in one bounded delivery.

Commit expected on `main`.
