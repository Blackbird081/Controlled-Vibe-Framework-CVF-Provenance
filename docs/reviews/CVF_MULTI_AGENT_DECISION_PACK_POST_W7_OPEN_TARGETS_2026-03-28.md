# CVF Multi-Agent Decision Pack — Post-W7 Open Architecture Targets

Memory class: FULL_RECORD

> Review mode: `MULTI_AGENT_DECISION_PACK`
> Purpose: final pre-integration decision pack after intake review, rebuttal, and supplemental EA counter-review are complete
> Decision posture: convert the current post-W7 open-target debate into one canonical sequencing decision and one bounded follow-on dependency model

---

## 1. Decision Scope

- Decision pack ID: `POST_W7_OPEN_TARGETS_DECISION_PACK_2026-03-28`
- Date: `2026-03-28`
- Intake review: `docs/reviews/CVF_MULTI_AGENT_INTAKE_REVIEW_POST_W7_OPEN_TARGETS_2026-03-28.md`
- Rebuttal packet: `docs/reviews/CVF_MULTI_AGENT_REBUTTAL_POST_W7_OPEN_TARGETS_2026-03-28.md`

Supplemental EA evidence used during convergence:

- `docs/reviews/archive/CVF_EA_INDEPENDENT_COUNTER_REVIEW_POST_W7_OPEN_TARGETS_2026-03-28.md`

Scope note:

- this decision pack is the canonical `GC-027` step 3 artifact
- the EA counter-review is treated as supplemental evidence, not as a replacement for the canonical decision pack

## 2. Decision Matrix

- candidate:
  - `Candidate A` — Trust / Isolation + Model Gateway boundary convergence
- current decision: `GO WITH FIXES`
- why:
  - this is the strongest first structural family because it addresses the highest-value unresolved boundary problem without forcing a full omnibus continuation wave
  - it is also the family most likely to reduce ambiguity for later work in `Agent Definition`, gateway authority, and execution governance
  - this candidate is approved only as a **future GC-018 candidate family**, not as implementation authorization by itself

- candidate:
  - `Candidate B` — RAG + Context Engine convergence
- current decision: `GO WITH FIXES`
- why:
  - this is the strongest fallback and likely second structural family
  - it has the cleanest already-delivered substrate in the current whitepaper, but its scope must stay downstream of whichever gateway/boundary assumptions are frozen by Candidate A

- candidate:
  - `Candidate C` — Performance benchmark harness and acceptance-policy baseline
- current decision: `GO WITH FIXES`
- why:
  - this is not treated as a competing business family
  - it is accepted as a **parallel prerequisite workstream** that may run alongside the first structural family, provided it stays instrumentation-only and does not claim performance targets as current baseline truth

- candidate:
  - `Candidate D` — Reputation + Task Marketplace learning expansion
- current decision: `HOLD`
- why:
  - the current learning plane is already strongly delivered through `W4-T25`, but this candidate remains an expansion target rather than a current architecture bottleneck
  - it should follow the first structural family and the performance baseline workstream

## 3. Pass Conditions

- condition 1:
  - no omnibus post-W7 continuation candidate may be opened; every future `GC-018` packet must name exactly one proposal family as its primary structural scope
- condition 2:
  - any `Candidate A` packet must include a W7 schema impact assessment covering the dependency chain `Runtime -> Artifact -> Trace -> Planner -> Decision -> Eval/Builder -> Memory`
- condition 3:
  - `Agent Definition` is excluded from the first `Candidate A` wave unless a blocking-dependency proof is provided with code-traceable evidence
- condition 4:
  - any `Candidate A` packet must freeze AI Gateway contract surfaces that face the Knowledge Layer unless the packet explicitly includes those surfaces and explains why that added scope is unavoidable
- condition 5:
  - any `Candidate B` packet must declare its dependency on gateway stability and identify which gateway assumptions are treated as fixed inputs
- condition 6:
  - `Candidate C` may run only as instrumentation / measurement / acceptance-threshold work; it must not promote the whitepaper's latency table into baseline truth before benchmark evidence exists
- condition 7:
  - every future `GC-018` packet must include:
  - current authoritative path(s)
  - target authoritative path(s)
  - `keep / retire / merge-into` ownership map
  - explicit `not in this wave` exclusions
- condition 8:
  - `L0-L4` migration is out of scope for the first post-W7 structural wave unless opened as a separate, explicitly justified proposal
- condition 9:
  - the next decision cycle should complete within 7 calendar days from acceptance of this decision pack to avoid indefinite documentation-only drift

## 4. Canonical Ownership Map

- concept:
  - first-wave structural convergence
- keep:
  - delivered W7 governance integration chain as current authoritative baseline
  - existing learning-plane bridge closure through `W4-T25`
  - current `R0-R3` risk model baseline
- retire:
  - the idea of one bundled post-W7 continuation wave covering all remaining partial/proposal targets
- owner:
  - Architecture Authority via future `GC-018` candidate drafting

- concept:
  - Candidate A
- keep:
  - boundary clarification focus
  - trust/isolation and model-gateway convergence as the first structural concern
- retire:
  - any assumption that `Agent Definition` automatically belongs in wave 1
- owner:
  - Governance / Execution architecture owners in the future `GC-018` packet

- concept:
  - Candidate B
- keep:
  - knowledge-query, ranking, and deterministic context packaging as already-delivered substrate
- retire:
  - any assumption that Family B is independent of gateway stability declarations
- owner:
  - Control-plane architecture owners in the future `GC-018` packet

- concept:
  - Candidate C
- keep:
  - benchmark harness, trace capture, acceptance policy, representative path definitions
- retire:
  - any framing that performance is merely a later optional optimization
- owner:
  - Cross-plane architecture / governance performance owners

- concept:
  - Candidate D
- keep:
  - learning expansion as a valid long-term direction
- retire:
  - any claim that it should displace boundary clarification or measurement groundwork
- owner:
  - Learning-plane architecture owners in a later future `GC-018`

## 5. Execution Order

- step 1:
  - accept this decision pack as the canonical `GC-027` convergence point for the current post-W7 open-target debate
- step 2:
  - prepare one fresh `GC-018` continuation candidate for `Candidate A`, bounded to trust/isolation + model-gateway boundary convergence with explicit exclusions
- step 3:
  - in parallel, prepare one lightweight instrumentation-only `GC-018` candidate for `Candidate C`
- step 4:
  - keep `Candidate B` as the designated second structural family unless the `Candidate A` packet proves it should be deferred
- step 5:
  - keep `Candidate D` deferred until the first structural family and performance baseline workstream are both in motion or closed

## 6. Next Recommended Tranche

- next tranche:
  - unassigned post-W7 `GC-018` candidate family for `Candidate A`
- gating control:
  - fresh `GC-018` authorization only; this decision pack is not implementation authorization
- out-of-scope items:
  - bundled all-family continuation
  - `L0-L4` migration
  - reputation / marketplace learning expansion as the first wave
  - benchmark target numbers presented as current baseline truth
  - agent-definition merge work unless blocking dependency is proven
