## Purpose

Wave 2 closes the remaining strict front-door rewrite debt after Wave 1 hygiene.

This note records the formal promotion of the 10 formerly `REVIEW_REQUIRED` linked templates after their forms, packet prompts, and output structures were rewritten into plain-language non-coder handoff mode.

---

## Scope Delivered

The following surfaces were rewritten so that:

- inputs now ask for goals, workflows, constraints, approvals, and preserved boundaries in plain language
- hidden technical translation moved into the generated packet instead of the visible form
- outputs now end in builder handoff and/or acceptance layers that a non-coder can review

Affected templates:

1. `code_review`
2. `documentation`
3. `data_analysis`
4. `ab_test_review`
5. `api_security`
6. `data_handling`
7. `app_builder_complete`
8. `api_design`
9. `vibe_logic_mapping`
10. `web_ux_redesign_system`

## Template Class Overrides

| Template ID | Override Class | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code_review` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Output now frames risks, impact, and builder handoff in plain language |
| `documentation` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Reframed around operational documentation and handoff instead of developer-only docs |
| `data_analysis` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Inputs and outputs now support decision-ready interpretation without statistical jargon |
| `ab_test_review` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Experiment review now ends with decision guidance instead of technical stats interpretation |
| `api_security` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Security review now starts from sensitive business flows rather than endpoint inventory |
| `data_handling` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Data lifecycle review now uses source/storage/sharing language accessible to non-coders |
| `app_builder_complete` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Full app brief now captures product intent and guarded boundaries without exposing stack decisions |
| `api_design` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Rewritten as an integration handoff packet instead of forcing API-style choices on the user |
| `vibe_logic_mapping` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Style translation no longer requires tech stack disclosure from the end user |
| `web_ux_redesign_system` | `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` | Added explicit review gate so UX approval is separated from runtime-changing build work |

## Resulting Strict Front-Door Posture

After applying this Wave 2 note and rebuilding the governed index:

- front-door skills remain `42`
- linked strict front-door templates remain `50`
- linked `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` templates become `50`
- linked `REVIEW_REQUIRED` templates become `0`
- linked `REJECT_FOR_NON_CODER_FRONTDOOR` templates remain `0`
- linked `UNSCREENED_LEGACY` templates remain `0`

Benchmark truth remains unchanged:

- frozen benchmark-ready subset remains `9`
- `api_design` is promoted to trusted supporting front-door status only
- `web_build_handoff` remains trusted supporting front-door status only

---

## Operational Meaning

Wave 2 closes the strict front-door rewrite program.

From this point forward:

1. the visible front door is all-trusted under the current 42-skill / 50-template scope
2. any newly added front-door surface must land already packet-ready and classified
3. future corpus work may expand or refine the library, but no remaining review-only debt blocks unrelated front-door product work
