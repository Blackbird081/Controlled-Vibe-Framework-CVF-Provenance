Memory class: SUMMARY_RECORD

> Decision type: `Fast Lane` additive documentation wave

> Tranche: W72-T2
> Control point: CP1 (single control point — documentation-only wave)
> Control: GC-021
> Active execution plan: this document

## 1. Proposal

- **Change ID:** W72-T2-CP1-KNOWLEDGE-COMPILATION-DOCTRINE-UPLIFT
- **Date:** 2026-04-14
- **Tranche:** W72-T2
- **Wave class:** `DOCUMENTATION / GOVERNANCE UPLIFT`
- **Active execution plan:** this document

**Summary:** Absorb the accepted LLM-Powered doctrine (`Ingest → Compile → Govern → Query → Maintain → Refactor`)
into CVF-native governance documentation. Produces 4 reference documents: lifecycle policy, compiled artifact
standard, context governance policy, and maintenance/refactor owner map. No code, no runtime, no guard family.

This CP1 covers the entire W72-T2 wave (documentation-only; no separate implementation CP needed).

---

## 2. Doctrine Documentation (Mandatory First Step)

Per `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` and GC-043, doctrine/governance-first absorption must be completed before any
implementation-first expansion. W72-T1 landed the first bounded implementation value (StructuralIndexContract).
W72-T2 closes the doctrine gap above that implementation.

### What this wave absorbs

**From LLM-Powered (`CVF_KNOWLEDGE_COMPILATION_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md` — ADAPT_HEAVY, file #6 in promotion map):**

The synthesis note established:
> The strongest doctrine contribution across all 3 folders is the concept of knowledge compilation —
> treating raw external sources as input material that must be compiled into governed, reusable knowledge
> artifacts before entering context pipelines.

The corrected lifecycle (6-step, mandatory):
```
Ingest → Compile → Govern → Query → Maintain → Refactor
```
Note: the original source used a 5-loop description that omitted `Govern` between `Compile` and `Query`.
This wave uses only the corrected 6-step form and makes `Govern` explicit.

**From LLM-Powered (#7, #8, #9 — ADAPT_MEDIUM / SALVAGE_VOCABULARY):**
- Compiled Knowledge Artifact field vocabulary (provenance, citation, schema compliance)
- Compiled-context preference with raw-source fallback
- Knowledge maintenance operations (lint, orphan detection, staleness, contradiction detection, drift)

**From Graphify (W72-T1 landed):**
- `StructuralIndexContract` is now the implemented `Query` mode companion for structural retrieval
- This wave binds it explicitly to the `Query` step in the lifecycle

**From Palace (#12, #13 — SALVAGE_VOCABULARY):**
- Hierarchical routing vocabulary (`wing/hall/room/drawer`) noted as candidate enrichment only; not absorbed into
  policy yet — deferred to future W7MemoryRecord enrichment wave

### CVF-native owner-surface mapping

| Concept | CVF Owner | This wave's output |
|---|---|---|
| 6-step knowledge lifecycle | Knowledge Layer + Context Builder + Learning Plane | Lifecycle Policy (Deliverable A) |
| Compiled Knowledge Artifact definition | Knowledge Layer | Artifact Standard (Deliverable B) |
| Compiled-context preference + fallback | Context Builder | Context Governance Policy (Deliverable C) |
| Knowledge maintenance/refactor operations | Learning Plane | Maintenance Owner Map (Deliverable D) |

### No-new-surface confirmation

- No new architecture surface created
- No new guard family created
- No CLI command surface created
- No implementation changes — additive documentation only
- Palace vocabulary deferred; not absorbed into policy this wave

---

## 3. Eligibility Check (Fast Lane)

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| already-authorized tranche | YES — operator locked W72-T2 as default next per roadmap and AGENT_HANDOFF.md |
| additive only | YES — 4 new reference docs + 1 AGENT_HANDOFF.md update; no edits to existing reference docs |
| no physical merge | YES — no source files moved from `.private_reference/` |
| no ownership transfer | YES — all new docs land in `docs/reference/` (existing owner surface) |
| no runtime authority change | YES — no guard engine changes, no provider lane, no execution plane |
| no target-state claim expansion | YES — lifecycle framed as policy, not as implementation authority |
| no concept-to-module creation | YES — no new module; documentation only |
| doctrine-first rule satisfied (GC-043) | YES — W72-T1 implementation closed; T2 is the doctrine uplift before any further implementation |

**Fast Lane eligible: YES**

## 4. Scope

**Files created (docs/reference/):**
- `CVF_KNOWLEDGE_COMPILATION_LIFECYCLE_POLICY_2026-04-14.md`
- `CVF_COMPILED_KNOWLEDGE_ARTIFACT_STANDARD_2026-04-14.md`
- `CVF_COMPILED_CONTEXT_GOVERNANCE_POLICY_2026-04-14.md`
- `CVF_KNOWLEDGE_MAINTENANCE_AND_REFACTOR_OWNER_MAP_2026-04-14.md`

**Files created (docs/baselines/):**
- `CVF_W72_T2_KNOWLEDGE_COMPILATION_DOCTRINE_UPLIFT_GC021_FAST_LANE_AUDIT_2026-04-14.md` (this file)

**Files modified (additive only):**
- `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` — record W72-T2 as CLOSED DELIVERED; set W72-T3 as candidate follow-on

**Out of scope:**
- No changes to any CPF/EPF/GEF/LPF contracts or tests
- No changes to `cvf-web`, provider adapters, or PVV surfaces
- No whitepaper canonical edits
- No CLI surface
- No Palace code rescue or promotion
- No new guard family
- No compiled-first or graph-first policy default (requires benchmark evidence — deferred to W72-T3)

**Caller / consumer affected:** none — new exports only; all existing consumers unchanged

---

## 5. Why Fast Lane Is Safe

- Purely additive documentation: 4 new reference files
- No changes to existing governed contracts, tests, or policies
- All content derived from CVF-native synthesis language (synthesis note + promotion/rejection map)
- No source folders used directly; no physical merge
- GC-023 compliance maintained — all new files are under threshold
- Rollback unit: delete 4 new reference docs + revert AGENT_HANDOFF.md change; no other state changes
