# GC-018 Authorization — W75-T1: KnowledgeContextAssemblyContract

**Authorization Date:** 2026-04-14
**Tranche:** W75-T1
**Class:** REALIZATION
**Authorized by:** Operator (explicit authorization 2026-04-14)

## Authorization Statement

W75-T1 is authorized to implement `KnowledgeContextAssemblyContract` and `KnowledgeContextAssemblyBatchContract` as the **consumer-facing output surface** of the CPF Knowledge Layer. This contract assembles `RankedKnowledgeItem` results with optional `StructuralNeighbor` enrichment into a `KnowledgeContextPacket` ready for LLM consumption.

## Scope Boundaries

**Allowed:**
- `KnowledgeContextEntry` type per ranked item (content-bound `entryHash`, time-variant `entryId`)
- `KnowledgeContextPacket` type (content-bound `packetHash`, time-variant `packetId`)
- `structuralEnrichment?: Record<string, StructuralNeighbor[]>` — optional itemId-keyed map
- `contextWindowEstimate: number` — sum of `content.length` for all entries
- Batch surface via `KnowledgeContextAssemblyBatchContract`
- Barrel exports in `control.plane.knowledge.barrel.ts`

**Not allowed in this tranche:**
- Actual LLM prompt building or token counting
- Any write to stores or Learning Plane
- New guard families or validation contracts
- CLI/runtime surface changes

## Dependency

Depends on `RankedKnowledgeItem` from `knowledge.ranking.contract.ts` and `StructuralNeighbor` from `knowledge.structural.index.contract.ts`.

Hash semantics are expected to cover the assembled entry payload, including structural enrichment
when present, rather than only the pre-assembly ranked item core.
