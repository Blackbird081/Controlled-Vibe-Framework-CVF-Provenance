## GC-018 Continuation Candidate

```
GC-018 Continuation Candidate
- Candidate ID: GC018-W72-T4-KNOWLEDGE-COMPILED-ARTIFACT
- Date: 2026-04-14
- Parent doctrine audit: docs/baselines/CVF_W72_T4_KNOWLEDGE_COMPILED_ARTIFACT_GC021_FAST_LANE_AUDIT_2026-04-14.md
- Intake packet: docs/reference/CVF_COMPILED_KNOWLEDGE_ARTIFACT_STANDARD_2026-04-14.md
- Proposed scope: W72-T4 — Knowledge Layer Compiled Artifact Implementation
  Add CompiledKnowledgeArtifactContract + CompiledKnowledgeArtifactBatchContract to CPF
  Knowledge Layer.
  CompiledKnowledgeArtifactContract.compile() produces a governed artifact (pending state)
  with deterministic artifactHash bound to content, sourceIds, citationTrail, contextId,
  artifactType, compiledBy, and citationRef. artifactId derived from artifactHash + compiledAt.
  CompiledKnowledgeArtifactContract.govern() transitions pending → approved|rejected,
  sets governedAt and preserves rejectionReason when rejected; artifactHash unchanged.
  CompiledKnowledgeArtifactBatchContract.batch() wraps multiple compile requests following
  the established CPF batch contract pattern. batchHash includes all per-artifact hashes.
  Both contracts are additive siblings of StructuralIndexContract in
  control.plane.knowledge.barrel.ts.
- Continuation class: REALIZATION
- Active test baseline: CPF 3060 / EPF 1301 / GEF 625 / LPF 1493 all pass (2026-04-14)
- Lowest dimension: Knowledge Layer compiled artifact capability (real gap, confirmed by W72-T2)
- Quality-first decision: EXPAND_NOW
- Why expansion is the right move now:
    W72-T2 defined the artifact standard; W72-T3 closed the documentation lane.
    The artifact standard is precise (13 governed fields including content and rejectionReason,
    3 types, lifecycle state machine).
    CPF Knowledge Layer is mature and tested (3060 tests). The implementation gap is bounded
    and the owner surface is established. Implementing now closes the compile step of the
    knowledge lifecycle with minimal blast radius.
- Quality protection commitments:
    - tsc + vitest must pass before commit
    - GC-023 file-size compliance at every commit
    - No changes to existing contracts or tests
    - No changes to cvf-web, provider adapters, or PVV surfaces
    - No new guard family, no CLI surface, no whitepaper edit
- Active-path impact: NONE — no provider execution, no PVV lane, no runtime change
- Expected enforcement class: CONTRACT (governed artifact with deterministic hash + state machine)
- Required evidence if approved:
    - tsc clean
    - all new tests pass
    - no regressions in existing CPF tests
    - control.plane.knowledge.barrel.ts exports CompiledKnowledgeArtifactContract + batch
    - GC-023 violations: 0
```

## Authorization Decision

**AUTHORIZED — proceed with W72-T4 implementation immediately.**

Scope is tightly bounded:
- CPF Knowledge Layer only: 2 new source files + 2 new test files + barrel export additions
- No edits to existing CPF contracts or tests
- No changes to EPF, GEF, LPF, or cvf-web
- No provider adapters, PVV lanes, or execution plane changes
