> Date: 2026-04-14
> Status: AUTHORIZED

## 1. Authorization Subject

Tranche `W85-T1 Post-W84 Canon Truth Sync` is hereby authorized.

This is a **narrow canon-sync correction** tranche. Its sole purpose is to advance the front-door canon surfaces from W83 to W84 truth. It does not introduce new capability, rerun benchmarks, change policy decisions, or reinterpret W84 evidence.

---

## 2. Mandate

Align the following three front-door canon surfaces to the already-filed W84-T1 truth:

1. `docs/reference/CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md`
2. `docs/reference/CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
3. `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`

---

## 3. Source Truth Inputs (Read-Only)

The following documents are the authorized source of truth for this sync. Their content must not be altered:

- `docs/baselines/CVF_GC018_W84_T1_KNOWLEDGE_LIVE_BENCHMARK_EVIDENCE_PROMOTION_AUTHORIZATION_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/baselines/CVF_W84_T1_BENCHMARK_RUN_MANIFEST_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/baselines/CVF_W84_T1_KNOWLEDGE_LIVE_BENCHMARK_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/assessments/CVF_W84_T1_POST_RUN_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/baselines/CVF_GC026_TRACKER_SYNC_W84_T1_CLOSED_2026-04-14.md`
- `docs/assessments/CVF_W85_T1_POST_W84_CANON_SYNC_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-14.md`

---

## 4. Authorized Scope

Exactly and only:

- Advance `Last canonical closure` in whitepaper from `W83-T1` to `W84-T1`
- Advance `Current active tranche` in whitepaper to reflect no active tranche post-W84
- Update `Current posture` in whitepaper to mention live benchmark evidence promotion through W84
- Advance `Last refreshed` in progress tracker from `W83-T1` to `W84-T1`
- Advance `Current active tranche` in progress tracker to match post-W84 state
- Add `W84-T1` row to progress tracker tranche table
- Add `W85-T1` row to progress tracker tranche table
- Update `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` to replace temporary reviewer-correction posture with final W85-T1 closure wording
- File GC-026 closure sync for W85-T1

---

## 5. Hard Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

- Do **not** rerun the benchmark.
- Do **not** modify the W84 evidence packet numbers or the `+0.111` delta.
- Do **not** reopen W78/W79/W84 policy conclusions.
- Do **not** change the decision `HYBRID / NO SINGLE DEFAULT CONFIRMED`.
- Do **not** create any new architecture surface or new default policy.
- Do **not** modify any CPF/EPF/GEF/LPF test files.
- Do **not** touch unrelated plane trackers or documentation families.
- Do **not** perform any code changes.

---

## 6. Decision Rationale

W84-T1 is evidence-complete and governance-complete. The packet, run manifest, post-run assessment, and GC-026 closure sync are all filed. The only remaining gap is that the front-door canon surfaces — whitepaper and progress tracker — still record W83-T1 as the latest governed closure. This creates a shallow but clear mismatch between packet-level truth and canon-level truth.

W85-T1 is the minimal correction required to close this gap. No new work is needed. The correction is a documentation sync, not a capability addition.

---

## 7. Exit Criteria

W85-T1 is complete when all of the following are true:

1. `CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` records `Last canonical closure = W84-T1`
2. `CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` records `Current active tranche = NONE — W84-T1 + W85-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED`
3. `CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` records `latest governed closure W84-T1` (via W85-T1 sync)
4. `CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` has W84-T1 and W85-T1 rows in the tranche table
5. `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` records W85-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED and removes the pending-sync reviewer note
6. `CVF_GC026_TRACKER_SYNC_W85_T1_CLOSED_2026-04-14.md` is filed
7. No benchmark was rerun; no policy decision was changed; no capability was added
