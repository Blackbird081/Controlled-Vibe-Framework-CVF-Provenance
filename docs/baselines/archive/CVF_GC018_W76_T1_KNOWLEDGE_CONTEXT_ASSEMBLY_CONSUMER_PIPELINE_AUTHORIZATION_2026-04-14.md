# GC-018 Authorization — W76-T1: KnowledgeContextAssemblyConsumerPipelineContract

**Authorization Date:** 2026-04-14
**Tranche:** W76-T1
**Class:** REALIZATION
**Authorized by:** Operator (explicit authorization 2026-04-14)

## Authorization Statement

W76-T1 is authorized to implement `KnowledgeContextAssemblyConsumerPipelineContract` and its batch variant as a CPF consumer pipeline bridge that chains `KnowledgeRankingContract` → `KnowledgeContextAssemblyContract` → `ControlPlaneConsumerPipelineContract` into a single `execute()` call. Follows the established consumer pipeline pattern (W1-T19 CP1).

## Scope Boundaries

**Allowed:**
- Single `execute()` chain: rank → assemble → consumer package
- Optional `structuralEnrichment?: Record<string, StructuralNeighbor[]>` pass-through
- Warning when `contextPacket.totalEntries === 0`
- Batch surface via `KnowledgeContextAssemblyConsumerPipelineBatchContract`
- Barrel exports in `control.plane.knowledge.barrel.ts`

The consumer package must be derived from the assembled context output, not rebuilt directly from
the pre-assembly ranked items alone.

**Not allowed in this tranche:**
- Any query contract invocation (candidates are caller-supplied)
- Any write to stores, Learning Plane, or external services
- New guard families, validation contracts, or CLI surface changes
