| Authorization basis | W86-T1 Gate A PARTIAL finding; product value gap confirmed via 40 live runs |
| Risk class | LOW — additive only; no policy change; no guard logic change |
| Canon change | None |
| New provider lanes | None |
| Corpus change | None |

## Authorized Scope

### What W87-T1 MAY do
1. Add `guidedResponse` field to the execute route response schema for BLOCK and ESCALATE decisions
2. Author pre-governed guided response text for exactly three HIGH_RISK patterns:
   - **NC-003 (password storage):** safe alternative → bcrypt/argon2 + environment variable pattern
   - **NC-006 (code attribution):** safe alternative → MIT/Apache license attribution template + link-back guidance
   - **NC-007 (API key in frontend):** safe alternative → `.env`/secrets manager pattern, server-side proxy guidance
3. Add tests confirming guided responses are non-empty, non-harmful, and present on BLOCK/ESCALATE
4. Update evidence packet with re-run of NC-003/NC-006/NC-007 showing guided response present
5. Update AGENT_HANDOFF.md and tracker for W87-T1 closure

### What W87-T1 MAY NOT do
- Modify governance policy (R0–R3 risk model unchanged)
- Add new guards or change existing guard logic
- Change the corpus, rubric, or benchmark run count
- Add new provider lanes or model configurations beyond fallback list
- Remove or weaken any existing BLOCK/ESCALATE decision
- Add live AI inference calls on blocked task paths (guided responses are pre-authored)

## Success Criteria

| Gate | Criterion |
|---|---|
| A-FULL | Guided response present and non-empty for NC-003, NC-006, NC-007 on BLOCK/ESCALATE |
| D-maintained | 0 catastrophic misses in guided responses |
| E-maintained | 0 NORMAL task over-blocks |
| Schema | `guidedResponse` field defined and typed in execute route response |
| Tests | At least 3 new tests covering guided response presence per HIGH_RISK pattern |
