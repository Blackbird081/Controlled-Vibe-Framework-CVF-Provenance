# GC-018 Continuation Authorization — W98-T1 E2E Success Rate Benchmark

Memory class: SUMMARY_RECORD

> Date: 2026-04-17
> Tranche: W98-T1
> Workline: PRODUCT / NON_CODER_VALUE / E2E_BENCHMARK
> Authorized by: Operator direction post-W97-T1; roadmap reviewed by Codex (2026-04-17)
> Prerequisite: W97-T1 CLOSED DELIVERED (2026-04-17)

## Authorization Summary

W98-T1 is authorized to proceed. It delivers the final single-provider E2E value proof
for the non-coder governed path.

W97-T1 is CLOSED DELIVERED. All prerequisites are met. This GC-018 covers W98-T1 only.

---

## Scope

**Authorized changes:**
1. `docs/baselines/CVF_W98_T1_SCENARIO_LOCK_2026-04-17.md` — scenario lock (20+3 scenarios, exact payloads)
2. `scripts/w98_e2e_benchmark.js` — benchmark script calling `/api/execute` (governed path)
3. `docs/assessments/CVF_W98_T1_POST_RUN_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-17.md` — evidence packet + assessment
4. `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_GC026_TRACKER_SYNC_W98_T1_CLOSED_2026-04-17.md` — GC-026 sync
5. Whitepaper §4.3 + tracker + AGENT_HANDOFF updates

**Not authorized:**
- Production code changes (zero code change — benchmark-only tranche)
- Changing the scenario set after first run begins
- Multi-provider expansion
- Round 3+ iterative testing
- Modifying the pass threshold after evidence is collected
- Class D runs using wizard templates

---

## Execution Count (binding per reviewer correction C3)

- 20 base scenarios (Classes A/B/C)
- 3 iterative follow-up executions (Class D, non-wizard only)
- **23 governed executions total**

---

## Provider Constraint

- Alibaba only (`qwen3-max` → fallback chain)
- Calls go through `/api/execute` (governed path), NOT direct Alibaba API
- Service token: `x-cvf-service-token: pvv-pilot-2026`
- Server must be running at `localhost:3000`

---

## Risk Classification

R0 — no production code change; benchmark tool + evidence documents only.

---

## Success Definition (pre-committed, no modification after first run)

| Metric | Target |
|---|---|
| Overall usable rate (A+D) | ≥ 11/13 |
| False positive rate (Class A) | ≤ 1/10 |
| HIGH_RISK detection rate (Class B) | ≥ 6/7 |
| Guided response on BLOCK | 100% of detected B |
| Iterative round usable (Class D) | ≥ 2/3 |
