Three samples verified: `cvf-downstream-note-taker-cli` (cli-productivity), `cvf-downstream-webapp-planner` (web-app-planning), `cvf-downstream-data-analyzer` (data-analysis). All 3 doctor `11/11 PASS`, all 3 tests pass, sample 3 includes a secret-free workspace-to-web bridge receipt that references live Web evidence. Script: `scripts/w114_cp7_multi_sample_downstream_proof.ps1`. Assessment: `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_MULTI_SAMPLE_DOWNSTREAM_PROOF_2026-04-23.md`. Raw: `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_W114_CP7_RAW_2026-04-23.json`.
- CP8 status: COMPLETE — W114 public evidence packet published at `docs/reference/CVF_W114_PUBLIC_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-23.md`. README and ARCHITECTURE updated to reflect CP7 downstream repeatability and bounded claims. All 7 W114 exit criteria satisfied. W114 is CLOSED DELIVERED. Assessment: `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_W114_T1_CP8_PUBLIC_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-23.md`.

The master architecture and core module posture are stable enough that the next highest-value work is not broad core expansion.

Current truth:

- CPF/GEF/LPF/EPF closure assessments remain the governing architecture baseline.
- W100-T1 reached `E2E VALUE PROVEN` for the one-provider non-coder governed path.
- W101-T1 wired knowledge-native context into `/api/execute`.
- W102-T1 proved knowledge-native benefit with live Alibaba inference.
- W112-T1 made downstream workspaces agent-enforcement-ready.
- W113-T1 proved one downstream adoption path with live web governance metadata.

Therefore the next priority is:

> Maximize the benefit a non-coder actually receives from CVF, and make that benefit repeatable, visible, and evidence-backed.

## 1. Architecture Boundary

This roadmap treats the current CVF core as stable-by-default.

Allowed core changes:

- small enforcement fixes required by live evidence;
- narrow interfaces needed to expose existing CVF value to workspace or web users;
- knowledge absorption from external repos only when it improves measured non-coder outcomes.

Non-goals:

- do not reopen master architecture without evidence of a core control gap;
- do not claim Web is the full CVF runtime;
- do not put provider API keys into downstream `.cvf/` artifacts;
- do not treat mock UI checks as governance proof;
- do not broaden provider parity claims from one-provider value proof.

## 2. Current Claim Baseline

CVF may already claim:

- one-provider non-coder governed value is proven;
- covered high-risk requests get safer handling and guidance;
- normal-task usefulness is preserved;
- approvals and follow-up rounds are present in the governed path;
- knowledge-native context can improve output quality;
- workspace bootstrap can enforce CVF agent protocol from the first downstream request when artifacts and doctor pass.

CVF must still bound the claim:

- one-provider value proof is not universal provider parity;
- one downstream sample is not universal downstream adoption proof;
- workspace doctor proof is not provider key proof;
- Web live proof is on the active governed AI path, not the whole CVF runtime.

## 3. W114 Goal

W114 should turn the current proof set into a stronger product claim:

> A non-coder can start from CVF Web or a CVF-governed workspace, receive visible governance guidance, produce useful work, iterate safely, and leave with evidence that CVF improved the outcome without hiding risk or leaking secrets.

This is stronger than "the framework works" and more useful than "many tests pass".

## 4. CP1: Non-Coder Value Scorecard Refresh

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Evidence:

- `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_NONCODER_VALUE_SCORECARD_2026-04-23.md`

Deliver:

- Create a 2026-04-22 scorecard that reconciles W86-W102 with W112-W113.
- Track dimensions:
  - task usefulness;
  - safe handling of high-risk requests;
  - guided fallback;
  - approval path;
  - risk visibility;
  - follow-up iteration;
  - knowledge-native improvement;
  - workspace adoption;
  - live evidence quality;
  - secret-handling safety.

Acceptance:

- Scorecard distinguishes `PROVEN`, `PARTIAL`, `NOT_PROVEN`, and `OUT_OF_SCOPE`.
- Every `PROVEN` row points to live API-backed evidence where it asserts governance behavior.

## 5. CP2: Secret-Free Workspace Live Readiness Check

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Evidence:

- `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_SECRET_FREE_WORKSPACE_LIVE_READINESS_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-23.md`

Delivered:

- `scripts/check_cvf_workspace_agent_enforcement.ps1 -CheckLiveReadiness`
- generated bootstrap log guidance in `scripts/new-cvf-workspace.ps1`
- secret-free output: reports presence/source/key name only; never prints raw key value

Boundary:

- normal workspace doctor still proves enforcement artifacts, not provider connectivity;
- missing key does not fail workspace enforcement;
- release-quality governance proof still requires `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json`.

Deliver:

- Add an optional downstream readiness command or doctor mode that checks whether the operator environment can support live governance proof.
- It must read env only and never write raw keys into downstream files.
- It should report only presence/classification, for example:
  - `live_key_available: true`
  - `provider_lane: alibaba`
  - `source: process_env | ignored_local_env`

Acceptance:

- Missing key produces clear guidance but does not fail the normal workspace enforcement doctor.
- Release-quality governance proof still uses `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json`.

## 6. CP3: Promote W113 Web Metadata Proof Into Release Discipline

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Decision:

- Promote `tests/e2e/w113-workspace-web-live-proof.spec.ts` into the default live release gate.
- `scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py` now includes this spec in the live Playwright list next to `noncoder-governance-live.spec.ts` and `governance-gate-live.spec.ts`.
- This means W112/W113 web governance metadata claims are release-gated by default instead of depending on a targeted run.

Verification note:

- Fresh verification passed after promotion: `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json`
- Result: `PASS`; UI mock `6 passed`; live governance `8 passed`.

Deliver:

- Decide whether `tests/e2e/w113-workspace-web-live-proof.spec.ts` should be included in the default live release gate.
- If included, update `scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py` and evidence docs.
- If not included, document why it remains a targeted proof.

Acceptance:

- W112 web metadata proof is either release-gated or explicitly bounded.
- No release-quality metadata claim depends on a forgotten targeted spec.

## 7. CP4: Non-Coder Outcome Evidence Pack

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Evidence:

- Script: `scripts/w114_noncoder_outcome_evidence_pack.js`
- Summary assessment: `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_NONCODER_OUTCOME_EVIDENCE_PACK_2026-04-23.md`
- Raw evidence: `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_NONCODER_OUTCOME_EVIDENCE_RAW_2026-04-23.json`

Result:

- `19/19` governed route decisions matched expected outcome.
- `12/12` allowed live-output runs were scored usable.
- `5/5` high-risk safety requests were blocked with visible guidance.
- `3/3` knowledge-native requests injected context and reflected expected project facts.
- `2/2` follow-up iteration requests produced refinement output.
- `2/2` approval-path requests produced pending approval artifacts.

Boundary:

- Allowed output tasks used the live Alibaba lane through `/api/execute`.
- Blocked and approval-path tasks intentionally stop before model execution after live route governance evaluation.
- Release-quality governance proof remains `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json`.

Deliver:

- Run a compact live evidence pack on the proven Alibaba lane.
- Recommended minimum:
  - 5 normal productivity tasks;
  - 5 high-risk safety tasks;
  - 3 knowledge-native tasks;
  - 2 follow-up iteration tasks;
  - 2 approval-path tasks.
- Capture:
  - task prompt;
  - provider/model;
  - governance decision;
  - risk classification;
  - output usefulness score;
  - user-visible guidance;
  - audit/evidence ids where available.

Acceptance:

- Evidence is live API-backed for governance claims.
- Raw API keys are never printed or committed.
- Summary states what improved for a non-coder, not just what tests passed.

## 8. CP5: Web Benefit Visibility Pass

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Evidence:

- Assessment: `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_WEB_BENEFIT_VISIBILITY_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-23.md`
- Implementation: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/components/ProcessingScreen.tsx`
- Tests: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/components/ProcessingScreen.test.tsx`

Delivered:

- Added a compact governance evidence panel to the main processing screen.
- The panel shows route-returned provider/model, governance decision, provider routing, knowledge source, output validation hint, policy snapshot id, envelope id, and approval id where present.
- `NEEDS_APPROVAL` responses with route-created `approvalId` now show the existing approval artifact directly instead of forcing a duplicate manual submit.

Verification:

- `npx vitest run src/components/ProcessingScreen.test.tsx` PASS, `19 passed`.
- `npm run lint -- src/components/ProcessingScreen.tsx src/components/ProcessingScreen.test.tsx` PASS.
- `npm run build` PASS.
- Final post-CP5 release gate: `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json` PASS; secrets scan PASS, UI mock `6 passed`, live governance `8 passed`.

Boundary:

- UI tests are not governance proof by themselves.
- The displayed metadata is backed by the live `/api/execute` route evidence from CP4 and the mandatory release gate.

Deliver:

- Review the main non-coder Web flow for visible value:
  - risk badge/explanation;
  - why a request was blocked or approved;
  - next safe action;
  - follow-up continuity;
  - knowledge context visibility;
  - provider lane transparency.

Acceptance:

- The user can understand what CVF did for them without reading admin docs.
- Any UI assertion of governance behavior has live-backed route evidence.

## 9. CP6: Workspace-To-Web Value Bridge

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Evidence:

- Assessment: `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_WORKSPACE_WEB_EVIDENCE_BRIDGE_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-23.md`
- Script: `scripts/write_cvf_workspace_web_evidence_bridge.ps1`
- Bootstrap update: `scripts/new-cvf-workspace.ps1`
- Downstream instructions update: `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/CVF_DOWNSTREAM_AGENTS_TEMPLATE.md`

Delivered:

- A downstream receipt generator that writes `docs/CVF_WORKSPACE_WEB_EVIDENCE_BRIDGE_<YYYYMMDD>.md`.
- The receipt runs the workspace doctor, optionally includes secret-free live readiness, references the CVF core release gate, and links to W114 CP4/CP5 evidence records.
- It explicitly records raw key values as `NOT PRINTED` and provider keys copied into downstream project as `NO`.

Verification:

- PowerShell parser check: PASS.
- Temporary downstream workspace verification: PASS.
- Generated bridge receipt recorded workspace doctor `PASS`, live readiness summary `live_key_available=true`, raw key values `NOT PRINTED`, and copied keys `NO`.
- Final post-CP6 release gate: `python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json` PASS; secrets scan PASS, UI mock `6 passed`, live governance `8 passed`.

Boundary:

- The bridge proves a repeatable evidence-linking pattern, not key distribution.
- Release-quality governance proof remains the CVF core release gate.

Deliver:

- Document or implement a repeatable path for a downstream workspace to use CVF Web governance proof without copying secrets.
- Candidate path:
  - workspace doctor verifies artifacts;
  - optional live readiness reports env availability;
  - CVF Web release gate proves live governance;
  - downstream freeze receipt links to the CVF evidence command and result.

Acceptance:

- A downstream non-coder project can point to evidence without storing secrets.
- The workspace claim remains agent-enforcement-ready, not key-distribution-ready.

## 10. CP7: Multi-Sample Downstream Proof

Status: COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

Evidence:

- Script: `scripts/w114_cp7_multi_sample_downstream_proof.ps1`
- Assessment: `docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_MULTI_SAMPLE_DOWNSTREAM_PROOF_2026-04-23.md`
- Raw results: `docs/assessments/archive/CVF_W114_CP7_RAW_2026-04-23.json`

Results:

| Sample | Kind | Doctor | Tests | Bridge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cvf-downstream-note-taker-cli` | cli-productivity | 11/11 PASS | 2 OK | N/A |
| `cvf-downstream-webapp-planner` | web-app-planning | 11/11 PASS | 3 OK | N/A |
| `cvf-downstream-data-analyzer` | data-analysis | 11/11 PASS | 3 OK | PASS |

Deliver:

- Extend W113 from one sample to at least three small downstream samples:
  - simple CLI/productivity utility;
  - web/app planning or build handoff;
  - data/content/business analysis task.

Acceptance:

- Each sample is outside CVF core.
- Each sample records first-request declaration, phase run, doctor pass, and freeze receipt.
- At least one sample includes live web governance evidence.

## 11. CP8: Public Evidence Packet Refresh

Deliver:

- Create a W114 public-safe evidence packet focused on non-coder benefit.
- Update README/ARCHITECTURE only after evidence exists.

Acceptance:

- Public wording says exactly what CVF helps a non-coder do.
- Claims remain bounded to validated provider lanes and validated surfaces.
- Known limitations remain visible.

## 12. Verification Rules

Release-quality governance proof remains:

```bash
python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json
```

Workspace enforcement proof remains:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check_cvf_workspace_agent_enforcement.ps1 `
  -ProjectPath "<downstream-project>"
```

Mock mode remains valid only for UI structure, static navigation, and non-governance rendering checks.

## 13. Exit Criteria

W114 closes only when:

- the non-coder scorecard is refreshed and evidence-linked;
- workspace live readiness is clearly separated from workspace enforcement;
- W113 web metadata proof is either release-gated or intentionally bounded;
- a compact live non-coder outcome evidence pack exists;
- Web visibly communicates CVF value in the main non-coder flow;
- downstream evidence expands beyond one sample or the one-sample boundary is explicitly retained;
- public docs say less than or equal to what the evidence proves.

## 14. Recommended Order

1. CP1 scorecard.
2. CP3 release-gate decision for W113 metadata proof.
3. CP2 secret-free workspace live readiness check.
4. CP4 compact live outcome evidence pack. COMPLETE 2026-04-23.
5. CP5 Web benefit visibility pass. COMPLETE 2026-04-23.
6. CP6 workspace-to-web evidence bridge. COMPLETE 2026-04-23.
7. CP7 multi-sample downstream proof. COMPLETE 2026-04-23.
8. CP8 public evidence packet refresh. COMPLETE 2026-04-23.

The goal is not more architecture for its own sake. The goal is to make CVF's existing governance machinery plainly useful to non-coders, with proof.
