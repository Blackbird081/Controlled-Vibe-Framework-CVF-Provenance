# CVF Template Quality Canonicalization Roadmap
**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Triggered by:** Skill portfolio canonicalization (131 → 62 → 27 active skills, commit d4b3382b)  
**Status:** CLOSED DELIVERED — Execution completed on 2026-04-26; planning body retained as historical audit baseline  
**Author:** Audit pass by Claude Code (Sonnet 4.6)

---

## 0. Closure Record — 2026-04-26

This roadmap began as a proposal, but the tranche was executed and closed on the
same day. Future agents should treat this file as a closed execution record and
should not re-open template-quality audit work unless a fresh regression appears.

### Delivered

- Phase 0+1 shipped in commit `d06c61cc`:
  - dead template references removed
  - missing live-skill mappings repaired where rescue was valid
  - governance CI gate added for RULE-T1 through RULE-T5
- Phase 2 shipped in commit `0f4c2491`:
  - remaining Silver/Bronze templates upgraded
  - `outputTemplate` coverage completed across the form-template catalog
  - full-rule enforcement enabled with no grandfather exceptions
- Contract hardening shipped in commit `30ff4c66`:
  - template intent rendering normalized
  - execute prompt contract bound more tightly to template output structure
  - regression/test coverage expanded

### Closed-State Snapshot

- Template registry: `53` total template objects
- Runnable form templates: `42`
- Wizards: `9`
- Folder containers: `2`
- Public Web skills: `27` across `9` public categories
- Form templates missing live mapping: `0`
- Form templates missing `outputTemplate`: `0`
- Public linked templates outside `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF`: `0`

### Verification

- Targeted regression gate passes in `cvf-web`:
  - `src/lib/templates/governance-enforcement.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/templates/index.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/skill-corpus-governance.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/skill-template-map.test.ts`
- Latest observed result on this repo state: `45/45` tests passed

### Continuation Rule

Do not spend future roadmap cycles re-auditing the template layer as if it were
still a proposal. The next product bottleneck is non-coder activation and
intent-to-starter-path routing, not template contract completeness.

---

## 1. Context & Motivation

The skill library was canonicalized from 131 → 27 active skills to enforce a quality-first standard. This audit applies the same standard to the template layer. A template that lacks governance backing (no live skill reference) or is structurally incomplete degrades the overall CVF UX and misleads users about what the platform can guarantee.

**Core principle:** Every template surfaced to users must be backed by a live skill, produce a complete governed spec, and have a verifiable output structure. Templates that cannot satisfy this must be removed, not archived.

**Column key:** F=field count, R=required fields, I=intentPattern, OE=outputExpected, OT=outputTemplate, SO=sampleOutput, MAP=skill mapping status (LIVE/DEAD/NONE)

### 2.4 Quality Distribution (Form templates, 6-point scoring)

| Bucket | Score | Count | Criteria failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🥇 Gold | 6/6 | **11** | None — production-ready |
| 🥈 Silver | 5/6 | **26** | Missing `outputTemplate` only |
| 🥉 Bronze | 4/6 | **11** | Missing `outputTemplate` + dead/no skill |
| ❌ DEAD mapping | — | **4** | Skill archived, no replacement in library |
| ⚠️ NONE mapping | — | **8** | No skill backing at all |

**Wizard quality (separate track):** All 9 wizards map to live skills. Wizards have empty `fields:[]` by design — their form logic lives in dedicated `*Wizard.tsx` components with multi-step state management.

### 2.5 Critical Findings

**F1 — 4 templates reference archived skills (data integrity breach):**
- `development/tech_stack_selection` → `02_tech_stack_selection` (archived)
- `development/database_schema` → `04_database_schema_design` (archived)
- `development/desktop_app_spec` → `06_desktop_app_spec` (archived)
- `development/local_deployment` → `08_local_deployment` (archived)

**F2 — 8 form templates have no skill governance backing:**
`non_coder_debug`, `auto_documentation`, `ab_test_review`, `feature_prioritization`, `error_handling_ux`, `grandma_ux_test`, `tos_review`, `architecture_review`

**F3 — 26 Silver templates structurally complete but missing `outputTemplate`:**  
Users can fill fields and get a governed spec, but the AI has no structured markdown skeleton to enforce output shape — reducing consistency of results.

**F4 — Only 4 Gold templates have `sampleOutput`:**  
`strategy_analysis`, `documentation`, `data_analysis`, `code_review` + 2 product UX templates. Without sample output, users cannot calibrate expectation quality.

**Special case — `ab_test_review`:**  
Score 5/6 despite no skill mapping (has fields, intent, outputExpected, outputTemplate). Highest-quality orphan. Recommend: add mapping to `product_ux/02_user_flow_analysis` rather than delete.

---

## 3. Proposed Template Quality Standard

### 3.1 CVF Template Quality Rules (mandatory for all new templates)

These rules must be enforced by CI via an automated test gate in `src/lib/templates/index.test.ts`.

**RULE-T1 — Minimum input richness**  
Form templates MUST have ≥3 input fields, with ≥1 marked `required: true`.  
Wizard templates are exempt (form logic in component).

**RULE-T2 — Intent completeness**  
`intentPattern` MUST be non-empty and MUST include:
- A `SUCCESS CRITERIA:` block with ≥3 measurable criteria
- An `OUTPUT FORMAT` block with named section headings

**RULE-T3 — Output definition**  
`outputExpected` MUST be present with ≥3 items.  
`outputTemplate` MUST be present (markdown skeleton for the AI to follow).

**RULE-T4 — Skill governance backing**  
Every template MUST appear in `skill-template-map.json` with a `skillId` that exists in `public/data/skills-index.json`.  
The CI test MUST validate this cross-reference at build time.

**RULE-T5 — No dead references**  
Any `skillId` in `skill-template-map.json` that is not present in the active skill library MUST be treated as a build error. Template must be re-mapped or removed before merge.

**RULE-T6 — Sample output (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)**  
`sampleOutput` SHOULD be present to set user quality expectations. Gold rating requires it.

### 3.2 Quality Tiers (enforced by rules)

| Tier | Criteria | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **Gold** | T1+T2+T3+T4+T5+T6 (all 6 rules) | Public showcase eligible |
| **Silver** | T1+T2+T3+T4+T5 (no sampleOutput) | Public listing eligible |
| **Bronze** | Fails any of T1–T5 | BLOCKED from merge |
| **Wizard** | T4+T5 + component exists | Separate track |

---

## 4. Action Plan

### Phase 0 — CI Gate (mandatory first, blocks everything else)
**Deliverable:** New test block in `src/lib/templates/index.test.ts`  
**Tests to add:**
1. All templates in `skill-template-map.json` have a matching template ID in the template array
2. All `skillId` values in `skill-template-map.json` exist in `skills-index.json`
3. All non-wizard form templates have `fields.length >= 3`
4. All non-wizard form templates have `intentPattern.length > 50`
5. All non-wizard form templates have `outputTemplate` defined
6. All non-wizard form templates are present in `skill-template-map.json`

> This gate transforms the quality standard from aspiration to enforcement. No template can regress once landed.

### Phase 1 — Hard deletions (12 templates removed)

**1A — Delete 4 dead-skill templates** (data integrity breach, delete immediately):
- `development/tech_stack_selection`
- `development/database_schema`
- `development/desktop_app_spec`
- `development/local_deployment`
- Also remove their entries from `skill-template-map.json`

**1B — Delete 7 unmapped templates** (no governance backing):
- `development/non_coder_debug`
- `development/auto_documentation`
- `product/feature_prioritization`
- `product/error_handling_ux`
- `product/grandma_ux_test`
- `security/tos_review`
- `technical/architecture_review`

**1C — Rescue decision on `ab_test_review`:**  
Option A (recommended): Add mapping `ab_test_review → product_ux/02_user_flow_analysis`, add `sampleOutput` → promote to Gold.  
Option B: Delete with the others.  
Argument for rescue: It has `outputTemplate` already (rare), strong fields, good intent structure — only missing governance link. Adding a mapping is a 2-line change.

**Result after Phase 1:**  
48 form templates → **36 form templates** (Option A: 37) + 9 wizards = **45–46 active templates**

### Phase 2 — Silver → Gold upgrade (26 templates)

Systematically add `outputTemplate` markdown skeletons to all 26 Silver templates.  
Priority order: business (3) → content (1) → development (7) → marketing (8) → product (6) → security (3) → security (1).

Each `outputTemplate` must follow the heading structure already defined in the template's `intentPattern` OUTPUT FORMAT block.

**Estimated effort:** ~30 min per template × 26 = 1 focused session.  
**Recommended approach:** Batch by domain, write all at once, run CI.

### Phase 3 — Add `sampleOutput` to remaining Gold templates

Currently only 6 templates have `sampleOutput`. After Phase 2 upgrade, add `sampleOutput` to all Gold templates to reach full 6/6 across the board.

**Targets:** All templates that reach 6/6 post-Phase-2 (est. 36 templates).

---

## 5. Post-Cleanup Expected State

| Metric | Before | After (Option A) |
|---|---|---|
| Total runnable templates | 56 (+ 2 folders + wizard 9) | 46 (+ 2 folders + wizard 9) |
| Templates with live skill | 45/56 (80%) | 46/46 (100%) |
| Gold templates | 11 (20%) | ~37 (80%) — after Phase 2+3 |
| Dead skill mappings | 4 | 0 |
| CI gate failures | No gate | Build fails on any violation |

---

## 6. Open Questions for Owner Decision

**Q1.** Delete or rescue `ab_test_review`?  
Recommendation: Rescue — 2-line mapping change, highest-quality orphan, has outputTemplate.

**Q2.** Delete `architecture_review` or merge into `system_design_wizard` scope?  
Recommendation: Delete — `code_review` (Gold) + `system_design_wizard` (Wizard) already cover this domain. A standalone Bronze template with no skill adds noise.

**Q3.** Phase 2 timing — same commit or separate tranche?  
Recommendation: Separate. Phase 0+1 can land immediately (cleanup). Phase 2 (26 outputTemplates) is content work that benefits from domain expertise review per category.

**Q4.** Should wizard templates also be required to have `outputTemplate` in their `Template` object?  
Recommendation: No. Wizard UX is controlled by the component. The governed spec is generated at the wizard's final step, which has its own structured output logic. Requiring it in the Template object creates false duplication.

## 7. Files to Change (Phase 0 + 1)

```
MODIFY: src/lib/templates/index.test.ts        (add 6 CI enforcement tests)
MODIFY: src/lib/templates/development.ts       (delete 4 dead + 2 unmapped)
MODIFY: src/lib/templates/product.ts           (delete 3–4 unmapped, rescue ab_test_review)
MODIFY: src/lib/templates/security.ts          (delete tos_review)
MODIFY: src/lib/templates/technical.ts         (delete architecture_review)
MODIFY: src/data/skill-template-map.json       (remove 4 dead entries, add ab_test_review if rescued)
```

## 8. Dissenting / Challenge Notes

*Adversarial review by independent agent (2026-04-26). 9 challenges raised.*

**C1 — Deletion list conflates registry gaps with quality failures.**  
`non_coder_debug` (4/6), `auto_documentation` (5/6), `grandma_ux_test`, `feature_prioritization`, `error_handling_ux` all have complete intent, fields, and success criteria. Their only failure is missing a `skill-template-map.json` entry — a 2-line JSON fix, not a content problem. The roadmap recommends deletion to solve a registry problem.  
→ *Revised action: attempt re-mapping to nearest live skill before deleting.*

**C2 — `ab_test_review` rescue to `user_flow_analysis` is semantically incorrect.**  
A/B test review is experiment decision-making (rollout/rollback under statistical uncertainty). `user_flow_analysis` is funnel and journey analysis. The skills are different domains. Mapping them creates a false governance link.  
→ *Revised action: delete for now; re-create correctly only when a `product_ux/experiment_review` skill exists.*

**C3 — `architecture_review` deletion is wrong — skill `02_architecture_review` already exists in the library.**  
`skill-template-map.json` already maps `system_design_wizard → 02_architecture_review`. The same skill can back `architecture_review` with a 1-line JSON entry. Deleting a template because its JSON registry entry is missing while the backing skill is live is an unnecessary loss.  
→ *Revised action: add `"architecture_review": { "domain": "technical_review", "skillId": "02_architecture_review" }` to the map. Add `outputTemplate`. Do not delete.*

**C4 — `tos_review` fills a real gap; `privacy_policy_audit` covers a legally distinct document.**  
ToS and Privacy Policy are separate legal instruments. The security domain would lose its only ToS audit path. `tos_review` scores 4/6 with only registry+sampleOutput missing.  
→ *Revised action: map to `02_data_privacy_compliance` (nearest live skill). Add `outputTemplate`. Retain.*

**C5 — Wizard governance claim is unverified. `SystemDesignWizard.tsx` uses a local `generateConsolidatedSpec()`, not `generateCompleteSpec()`.**  
The governed constraint blocks (Execution Constraints, Validation Hooks, CVF Non-Coder Success Standard, Governed Response Rules, Knowledge Preference) injected by `generateCompleteSpec` are absent from wizard-generated output. All 9 wizards must be verified.  
→ *New RULE-T7 required: Wizard components MUST use `generateCompleteSpec` or equivalent governed wrapper.*

**C6 — RULE-T2 CI gate is toothless. Test checks `intentPattern.length > 50`, not `SUCCESS CRITERIA:` presence.**  
Rule text and enforcement are decoupled. A 51-character intent passes T2 under the proposed test. Many Silver templates lack an `OUTPUT FORMAT:` block entirely.  
→ *Fix: CI test must assert `intentPattern.includes('SUCCESS CRITERIA:')` and `intentPattern.includes('OUTPUT FORMAT')` as substring checks.*

**C7 — 6-point score conflates content quality with governance registry.**  
`ab_test_review` (5/6, excellent quality, missing registry) scores same as a low-quality but fully-mapped template. The score is misleading as a single dimension.  
→ *Recommended fix: split into Content Score (T1+T2+T3+T6, max 4) and Governance Score (T4+T5, max 2). Both must be > 0 for display eligibility.*

**C8 — Phase 2 effort is underestimated.**  
Many Silver templates have no `OUTPUT FORMAT:` block in intentPattern. Adding `outputTemplate` correctly requires coordinating both changes per template. Estimate 45–60 min/template if RULE-T2 is simultaneously enforced, not 30 min.

**C9 — Dead-skill templates (1A) should be re-mapped before delete.**  
`tech_stack_selection` (9 fields), `database_schema` (7 fields) are structurally complete. They could map to `01_app_requirements_spec` and `03_architecture_design` respectively. Deleting loses content that took effort to build.  
→ *Check re-mapping feasibility first; delete only if semantics do not fit any live skill.*

---

**ADVERSARIAL VERDICT:** Roadmap is sound in framing but 3 deletions are wrong (`architecture_review`, `tos_review`, and `non_coder_debug`/`auto_documentation` family). RULE-T7 and T2 enforcement gap are real structural deficiencies. Fix these before execution.
