# CVF Demo Script

**Date:** 2026-04-21  
**Audience:** operators, collaborators, potential adopters  
**Default mode:** UI walkthroughs can run without paid API calls; any governance-quality proof must use live provider execution

---

## Before You Start

Prerequisites (all paths):

```bash
cd EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web
npm install
npm run dev
# Dev server starts at http://localhost:3000
```

No API key is required for UI-only walkthroughs.
An Alibaba or DeepSeek key is required before claiming that CVF governs real AI/agent output.

Claim boundary to keep in mind during any demo:

> CVF proves governed AI-assisted development. Multi-provider operability is proven for Alibaba and DeepSeek. Provider parity is not claimed. Provider economics are user-selected.

---

## Demo Path A — Non-Coder App Builder

**Audience:** stakeholders who want to see CVF's non-coder value proposition  
**Duration:** ~5 minutes  
**Live API call:** not required for UI walkthrough; required if used as governance proof

### What this demonstrates

A user with no coding background can create a governed application using CVF's front-door wizard. CVF handles structure, risk classification, and intake — the user only provides intent.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Open the landing page**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/landing`

Point out:
- bilingual support (toggle EN/VI)
- "Start Building" CTA
- the three value props: governed, multi-provider, non-coder accessible

**Step 2 — Enter the template gallery**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (home/dashboard)

Point out:
- curated template cards by use case
- categories: app builder, content strategy, data analysis, research, etc.
- each template has a governance tier displayed

**Step 3 — Select a non-coder starter template**

Select any template from the gallery (e.g., "App Builder" or "Business Strategy").

Click "Use Template" or "Start".

**Step 4 — Walk through the intake wizard**

The wizard walks through:
1. Project name and description
2. Target users
3. Primary goal
4. Risk appetite (low / medium / high)

Fill in minimal values — purpose is to show the structured intake, not to produce a real deliverable.

**Step 5 — Show the governance output**

After intake, CVF shows:
- risk classification (R0 / R1 / R2 / R3)
- suggested next steps per classification
- approval gates if risk level is elevated

**What to say:**

> "No code was written. CVF used the operator's intent to classify risk, propose a governed path, and gate the next action. This is the non-coder value path — governance without programming."

---

## Demo Path B — Governed Risk / Approval Path

**Audience:** engineering leads, security reviewers, governance stakeholders  
**Duration:** ~5 minutes  
**Live API call:** required if claiming runtime governance proof; UI-only simulation is not sufficient for publication

### What this demonstrates

CVF classifies AI operations by risk level and blocks or gates high-risk operations at runtime — not just in documentation.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Open the agent task panel**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and open or simulate an agent task.

If using a template with a high-risk operation step, proceed to that step.

**Step 2 — Trigger a high-risk classification**

Actions that typically classify as R2 or R3:
- "delete all project data"
- "publish to external API without review"
- "execute SQL migration on production database"

Enter any such intent in the agent input or select a high-risk template action.

**Step 3 — Show the High-Risk Guided Response panel**

CVF intercepts the action and displays:
- risk level badge (R2 or R3)
- plain-language explanation of why the action is high-risk
- required approval scope
- confirmation prompt: "Do you authorize this action within the stated scope?"

**Step 4 — Show the block behavior**

Do not confirm. Show that:
- the action does not proceed
- CVF explains what approval is needed
- the session audit trail records the attempted action and the block

**Step 5 — Show the approval path (optional)**

Confirm the action. Show that:
- CVF records the approval with scope
- the action proceeds within the approved scope
- the audit trail shows the full decision chain

**What to say:**

> "CVF enforces governed AI behavior at runtime. The governance is not advisory — it blocks the action. Approval is explicit, scoped, and auditable."

## Demo Path C — Provider Switch / Certified Lane

**Audience:** technical evaluators, multi-provider adopters, platform operators  
**Duration:** ~5 minutes (default); ~10 minutes with live canary  
**Live API call:** required for fresh certification or release-quality governance proof — requires operator key

### What this demonstrates

CVF supports multiple AI providers. DeepSeek is CERTIFIED by canary evidence; Alibaba's current `qwen-flash` target is EXPERIMENTAL pending fresh live proof (its historical receipt does not transfer). The operator can see lane status, inspect evidence, and run a live canary when fresh proof is required.

### Steps

**Step 1 — Open Settings**

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/settings` or open Settings from the sidebar.

**Step 2 — Show the Provider section**

Point out the provider cards:
- Anthropic (default, always present)
- Alibaba Cloud (qwen-flash)
- DeepSeek (deepseek-chat)

**Step 3 — Show lane status badges**

For DeepSeek, the lane badge displays:
- `Certified` (green badge)
- `3/3 PASS` pass window
- tooltip: "User-paid provider lane — Certification reflects CVF canary evidence, not universal provider parity"

For Alibaba, the lane badge displays:
- `Experimental` (badge)
- `Fresh live proof pending` pass window
- note: current target `qwen-flash`; historical Alibaba receipts do not transfer to this model

For an unconfigured provider (no key set), the badge shows `Unconfigured`.

**Step 4 — Explain the evidence chain**

Point to the operator documentation:
- `docs/reference/CVF_PROVIDER_LANE_READINESS_MATRIX.md` — current status per provider
- `docs/audits/alibaba-canary/INDEX.md` — Alibaba receipt index
- `docs/audits/deepseek-canary/INDEX.md` — DeepSeek receipt index

**What to say:**

> "The certification badge is not marketing. It reflects three consecutive canary runs — six governed scenarios each — where the provider returned correct, policy-compliant output. The receipts are stored in the repo."

**Step 5 — Switch provider (optional)**

Select Alibaba or DeepSeek in the ProviderSwitcher dropdown.

Show that the UI updates the active provider without a full reload.

**Step 6 — Run a live canary (requires API key for fresh proof)**

Do this before publishing a fresh claim about provider behavior. Only use operator-provided keys, and never print or commit key values.

```bash
# Exit dev server first or run in a separate terminal
python scripts/run_cvf_provider_live_canary.py --provider alibaba
# or
python scripts/run_cvf_provider_live_canary.py --provider deepseek
```

Expected output: 6/6 scenarios PASS, receipt printed to console.

**What to say:**

> "Multi-provider operability is proven. Provider parity is not claimed — Alibaba and DeepSeek have different latency, cost, and billing. The operator chooses which provider economics match their use case."

## Demo Notes for Operators

**What to avoid saying:**

- "CVF is production-ready for enterprise deployment" — say "CVF is a governance framework ready for governed development and evaluation"
- "All providers have the same performance" — say "CVF certifies behavioral compliance; provider economics vary"
- "CVF replaces your existing CI/CD" — say "CVF adds a governance layer over AI-assisted development"
- "This works with any model" - say "DeepSeek is certified; Alibaba's current target and other providers are experimental until canary-run"

**If asked about API keys during demo:**

> "UI walkthroughs can run without live API calls, but governance-quality proof requires an operator-supplied live provider key. No keys are committed, and raw values are never printed."

**If asked about E2E tests:**

> "CVF's release-quality gate includes live governance E2E. Mock Playwright tests are kept only for UI structure, not for proving AI governance."

**If asked about cost:**

> "CVF itself has no usage cost. Live canary runs consume the operator's provider API credits; consult current Alibaba pricing before execution."
