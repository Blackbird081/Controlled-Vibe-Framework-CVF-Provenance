## What is MC5?

MC5 (Master Closure 5) is the final milestone in CVF's architecture baseline completion sequence:

- **MC1**: CPF (Control Plane Foundation) Closure Assessment → **DONE-ready**
- **MC2**: GEF (Governance Expansion Foundation) Closure Assessment → **DONE (6/6)**
- **MC3**: LPF (Learning Plane Foundation) Closure Assessment → **DONE-ready (7/7)**
- **MC4**: EPF (Execution Plane Foundation) Closure Assessment → **DONE-ready**
- **MC5**: Whitepaper + Tracker Canon Promotion → **COMPLETE**

**Status**: MC1-MC5 sequence is **FULLY COMPLETE** as of W59-T1 (2026-04-07).

---

## Current Architecture Baseline

**Version**: `v3.7-W46T1`

**Document Type**: `CLOSURE-ASSESSED`

**Posture**:
- CPF: **DONE-ready** (2929 tests, 0 failures)
- GEF: **DONE (6/6)** (625 tests, 0 failures)
- LPF: **DONE-ready (7/7)** (1465 tests, 0 failures)
- EPF: **DONE-ready** (1301 tests, 0 failures)

**Deferred Items** (intentionally future-facing, not closure gaps):
- Model Gateway (provider routing) - boundary governance in CPF W8-T1 + W39-T1
- Sandbox Runtime (physical isolation) - worker agents governed via Dispatch/PolicyGate/CommandRuntime

**Reference**: [Master Architecture Whitepaper](../reference/CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md)

---

## CI/CD Coverage

**Before W61-T1**: 1.5% coverage (Guard Contract + MCP Server + cvf-web typecheck only)

**After W61-T1**: 100% coverage (8294 tests)

**New CI Jobs** (W61-T1):
- `test-cpf` (2929 tests)
- `test-epf` (1301 tests)
- `test-gef` (625 tests)
- `test-lpf` (1465 tests)
- `test-web-ui` (1853 tests)

**Build Verification**: Added `npm run build` for cvf-web

## Post-MC5 Continuation Strategy

With MC1-MC5 complete, CVF follows a structured continuation path defined in the Post-MC5 Continuation Strategy.

**Strategic Tracks**:

1. **Track 1**: CI/CD Expansion ⚡ → **COMPLETE** (W61-T1)
2. **Track 2**: cvf-web Product Hardening 🛠️ → **COMPLETE** (W61-T1)
3. **Track 3**: Pre-Public Packaging 📦 → **PENDING** (requires GC-018)
4. **Track 4**: Documentation Curation 📚 → **IN PROGRESS** (W62-T1)
5. **Track 5**: Deferred Architecture 🔮 → **FUTURE** (post May 2026)

**Reference**: [Post-MC5 Continuation Strategy](../roadmaps/CVF_POST_MC5_CONTINUATION_STRATEGY_ROADMAP_2026-04-08.md)

---

## What's Next?

### Immediate (W62-T1)

**Track 4: Documentation Curation** (DOCUMENTATION class, no GC-018 required)
- Audit sensitive content in `docs/`
- Define `PUBLIC_DOCS_MIRROR` boundary
- Refresh root docs to reflect CLOSURE-ASSESSED status

### Short-Term

**Track 3: Pre-Public Packaging** (requires GC-018 authorization)
- Phase A Targets: Guard Contract, MCP Server, Deterministic Reproducibility
- Add `exportReadiness` status and documentation
- Define packaging boundaries

### Future (post May 2026)

**Track 5: Deferred Architecture** (only if required)
- Model Gateway (provider routing)
- Sandbox Runtime (physical isolation)
- Agent Definition Registry L0-L4 consolidation

---

## Key Governance Changes

### GC-018: Continuation Governance

- **Rule**: Any new work requires fresh GC-018 authorization
- **Exception**: DOCUMENTATION class (Track 4) does not require GC-018
- **Purpose**: Prevent uncontrolled expansion after closure

### GC-019: Full Lane vs GC-021: Fast Lane

- **Full Lane**: New concepts, modules, cross-plane changes
- **Fast Lane**: Additive batch/summary work inside authorized tranche
- **Decision**: Per control point based on scope and risk

### GC-026: Progress Tracker Sync

- **Rule**: All tranches must sync with progress tracker
- **Events**: Authorization, CP completion, closure
- **Purpose**: Maintain continuity and traceability

2. **Understand the Architecture**: [Architecture Overview](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. **Review Current State**: This document (POST_MC5_ORIENTATION.md)
4. **Check Continuation Strategy**: [Post-MC5 Roadmap](../roadmaps/CVF_POST_MC5_CONTINUATION_STRATEGY_ROADMAP_2026-04-08.md)
5. **Read Governance Rules**: [Governance Control Matrix](../reference/CVF_GOVERNANCE_CONTROL_MATRIX.md)

---

## For Existing Contributors

If you worked on CVF pre-MC5:

**What Changed**:
- ✅ MC1-MC5 architecture baseline is complete and CLOSURE-ASSESSED
- ✅ CI coverage expanded from 1.5% to 100% (8294 tests)
- ✅ All 4 foundation planes assessed and closed
- ✅ Whitepaper promoted to CLOSURE-ASSESSED status
- ✅ Relocation lane closed-by-default
- ✅ New work requires GC-018 authorization (except DOCUMENTATION class)

**What Stayed the Same**:
- Core governance protocols (GC-018, GC-019, GC-021, GC-026)
- 5-phase controlled execution loop (INTAKE → DESIGN → BUILD → REVIEW → FREEZE)
- Guard contract and governance enforcement
- Test-driven development and evidence-based closure
