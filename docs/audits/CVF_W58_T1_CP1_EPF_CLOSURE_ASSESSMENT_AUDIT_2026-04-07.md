## 1. EPF Whitepaper Target-State Components

The whitepaper (`docs/reference/CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md` §4, Execution Plane diagram)
defines the following target-state components for the Execution Plane:

| Component | Whitepaper Label | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Dispatch family | (implied DELIVERED — W49 closed) | DONE — all contracts present |
| Policy Gate | [SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED] | DONE — all contracts present |
| Command Runtime + Async Command Runtime | [SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED] | DONE — all contracts present |
| Async Status + Reintake + Reintake Summary | [SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED] | DONE — all contracts present |
| Observer + Feedback Loop (Observer, Feedback, Feedback Routing, Feedback Resolution, Audit Summary, Pipeline) | [SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED] | DONE — all contracts present |
| MCP Bridge + Streaming + Streaming Aggregator | [SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED] | DONE — all contracts present |
| Multi-Agent Coordination + Coordination Summary + Consumer Result + Bridge Consumer | [SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED] | DONE — all contracts present |
| Model Gateway | **[PARTIAL]** | Intentional deferment — no EPF contract; boundary in CPF (W8-T1) |
| Sandbox Runtime (Worker Agents) | **[PARTIAL]** | Intentional deferment — no dedicated contract; worker agents governed via existing EPF surface |

**Logical grouping for DONE criteria (9 groups):**

| # | Group | Components |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dispatch | `DispatchContract` + `dispatch.batch.contract.ts` + consumer pipeline + consumer pipeline batch |
| 2 | Policy Gate | `PolicyGateContract` + `policy.gate.batch.contract.ts` + consumer pipeline + consumer pipeline batch |
| 3 | Command + Async Command Runtime | `CommandRuntimeContract` + `ExecutionAsyncRuntimeContract` + standalone batches (W51, W52) + consumer pipelines + consumer pipeline batches |
| 4 | Async Status + Reintake | `ExecutionAsyncStatusContract` + `ExecutionReintakeContract` + `ExecutionReintakeSummaryContract` + standalone batches (W53, W54) + consumer pipelines + consumer pipeline batches |
| 5 | Observer + Feedback Loop | `ExecutionObserverContract` + `ExecutionFeedbackContract` + `FeedbackRoutingContract` + `FeedbackResolutionContract` + `ExecutionAuditSummaryContract` + `ExecutionPipelineContract` + consumer pipelines + consumer pipeline batches |
| 6 | MCP Bridge + Streaming | `McpInvocationContract` + `ExecutionStreamingContract` + `ExecutionStreamingAggregatorContract` + `mcp.invocation.batch.contract.ts` + consumer pipelines + consumer pipeline batches |
| 7 | Multi-Agent + Bridge + Consumer Result | `ExecutionMultiAgentCoordinationContract` + `ExecutionMultiAgentCoordinationSummaryContract` + `ExecutionConsumerResultContract` + `ExecutionBridgeConsumerContract` + `execution.bridge.consumer.batch.contract.ts` (W48) + `execution.consumer.result.batch.contract.ts` + consumer pipelines + consumer pipeline batches |
| 8 | Model Gateway | No EPF contract — boundary governance in CPF; EPF provider routing future-facing | **INTENTIONAL DEFERMENT** |
| 9 | Sandbox Runtime | No dedicated contract — worker agents governed via EPF dispatch/policy/command surface | **INTENTIONAL DEFERMENT** |

## 6. EPF Dispatch Batch Wave Confirmation

Scan registry entry `epf_dispatch_batch_wave`: **FULLY_CLOSED** (W49–W54).
`epf.dispatch.barrel.ts` barrel present; `index.ts` present.
EPF dispatch family is confirmed FULLY CLOSED — not re-examined under this tranche.

## 7. Model Gateway Classification

**Evidence gathered:**

| Evidence | Finding |
|---|---|
| EPF src scan: model gateway contract | NOT PRESENT — no `model.gateway.contract.ts` or equivalent in EPF |
| CPF evidence: `ModelGatewayBoundaryContract` | PRESENT — W8-T1 (2026-03-29); boundary governance delivered from CPF side |
| `ModelGatewayBoundaryBatchContract` (CPF) | PRESENT — W39-T1 (2026-04-05); CPF batch surface closed |
| Whitepaper diagram annotation | "provider/rte convergence future-facing" |
| Whitepaper merge table entry | `CVF_v1.2.1_EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION + CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB → SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED` |
| Whitepaper merge table posture | `SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED — ModelGatewayBoundaryContract canonically closed W8-T1` |

**Classification: INTENTIONAL DEFERMENT**

Rationale:
1. The boundary governance perimeter for Model Gateway is established in CPF (W8-T1 `ModelGatewayBoundaryContract` + W39-T1 `ModelGatewayBoundaryBatchContract`). The governance contract governs what crosses the model gateway boundary — this IS delivered.
2. The EPF-side provider routing (actual LLM provider convergence through `CVF_v1.2.1_EXTERNAL_INTEGRATION` + `CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB`) is explicitly annotated in the whitepaper diagram as "future-facing". This represents a next-generation integration layer beyond the current closure baseline.
3. The whitepaper diagram label `[PARTIAL]` is a stale label that predates the CPF W8-T1 and W39-T1 closures. The merge table entry correctly reflects `SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED`. This is a **label currency gap** in the diagram only — not an implementation gap.
4. No new EPF implementation is needed to satisfy the current architecture closure baseline for Model Gateway. The governance perimeter is closed; provider routing convergence is intentionally scoped to future integration waves.

**Formal deferment recorded**: EPF provider routing (Model Gateway EPF side) remains outside the current closure baseline. Governed by future integration wave requiring fresh `GC-018` when `CVF_v1.7.3_RUNTIME_ADAPTER_HUB` merge is authorized.

---

## 8. Sandbox Runtime Classification

**Evidence gathered:**

| Evidence | Finding |
|---|---|
| EPF src scan: sandbox runtime contract | NOT PRESENT — no dedicated sandbox runtime contract |
| EPF worker agent governance coverage | PRESENT — `DispatchContract`, `PolicyGateContract`, `CommandRuntimeContract`, `ExecutionMultiAgentCoordinationContract` govern worker agent execution path |
| Whitepaper diagram annotation | "worker execution remains governed, but full target-state convergence is still not closed" |
| Multi-agent coordination surface | `execution.multi.agent.coordination.contract.ts` + coordination summary + consumer pipelines + batches — DONE |
| EPF dispatch + command surface | Dispatch (W49), PolicyGate (W50), CommandRuntime (W51), AsyncCommandRuntime (W52) — ALL DONE |

**Classification: INTENTIONAL DEFERMENT**

Rationale:
1. Worker agent execution IS governed through existing EPF contracts. `DispatchContract`, `PolicyGateContract`, and `CommandRuntimeContract` provide the governed execution surface for all worker agents. `ExecutionMultiAgentCoordinationContract` covers multi-agent orchestration. The governance architecture for worker agents is complete.
2. "Full target-state convergence" refers to fully isolated sandbox execution environments (resource quotas, network isolation, process containment per worker agent). This is a runtime infrastructure capability beyond the current architecture contract surface.
3. The whitepaper itself acknowledges "worker execution remains governed" — confirming the governance layer IS present. Only the physical sandbox isolation layer is not implemented, and this is intentionally a future-facing infrastructure concern outside the current closure baseline.
4. No new EPF contract is needed to satisfy the current architecture closure baseline for Sandbox Runtime. The governance contracts covering worker agent execution are present; physical isolation infrastructure is intentionally deferred.

**Formal deferment recorded**: Full runtime sandbox isolation for worker agents remains outside the current closure baseline. Governed worker execution is delivered. Sandbox isolation requires a dedicated future infrastructure wave with fresh `GC-018` when authorized.

## 9. EPF DONE Criteria Decision

| # | Group | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dispatch | DONE |
| 2 | Policy Gate | DONE |
| 3 | Command + Async Command Runtime | DONE |
| 4 | Async Status + Reintake | DONE |
| 5 | Observer + Feedback Loop | DONE |
| 6 | MCP Bridge + Streaming | DONE |
| 7 | Multi-Agent + Bridge + Consumer Result | DONE |
| 8 | Model Gateway | INTENTIONAL DEFERMENT — label currency gap in diagram; boundary governance in CPF; EPF provider routing future-facing |
| 9 | Sandbox Runtime | INTENTIONAL DEFERMENT — worker agents governed; physical sandbox isolation future-facing |

**EPF plane posture: DONE-ready**

All core execution contracts present and verified. Two items (Model Gateway EPF side, Sandbox Runtime full isolation) formally deferred as intentionally future-facing beyond the current closure baseline. No new EPF implementation required before MC5 whitepaper promotion.

## 10. Test Count Verification

| Plane | Before | After | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| EPF | 1301 | 1301 | 0 (no code changes) |
| CPF | 2929 | 2929 | 0 |
| GEF | 625 | 625 | 0 |
| LPF | 1465 | 1465 | 0 |

**All counts unchanged. ✓**

## 11. Scan Registry Update Required

- Add `epf_plane_scan` entry to `governance/compat/CVF_SURFACE_SCAN_REGISTRY.json`
- Status: `FULLY_CLOSED`
- lastScannedAt: `2026-04-07`
- nextAction: EPF is DONE-ready — Model Gateway and Sandbox Runtime formally deferred. Promote EPF plane row in MC5 whitepaper pass.
