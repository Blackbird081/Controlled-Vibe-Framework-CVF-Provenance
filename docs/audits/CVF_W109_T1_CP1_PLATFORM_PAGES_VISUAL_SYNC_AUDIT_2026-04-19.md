## Scope

Six platform page components restyled under the zero-logic-change contract:

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/(dashboard)/history/page.tsx` | Back-button hover: `dark:hover:bg-gray-800` → `dark:hover:bg-white/[0.07]` |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx` | Back-button hover: `dark:hover:bg-gray-800` → `dark:hover:bg-white/[0.07]` |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/marketplace/page.tsx` | No wrapper-level dark theme changes required — already aligned |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/governance/page.tsx` | Tab-strip bg, active-tab surface, simulation-link accent, ledger/approval card surfaces + borders |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/simulation/page.tsx` | Panel container borders: `dark:border-gray-700` → `dark:border-white/[0.07]` (2 instances) |
| `src/app/(dashboard)/safety/page.tsx` | Comprehensive restyling: card surfaces, borders, dividers, hover states, focus rings, blue→indigo accent shifts |

---

## Design Tokens Applied

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Deep bg | `dark:bg-[#0d0f1a]` |
| Surface bg | `dark:bg-[#1a1d2e]` |
| Border | `dark:border-white/[0.07]` |
| Muted border | `dark:border-white/[0.05]` |
| Hover surface | `dark:hover:bg-white/[0.05]`, `dark:hover:bg-white/[0.07]`, `dark:hover:bg-white/[0.1]` |
| Table header | `dark:bg-white/[0.05]` |
| Active tab | `dark:bg-white/[0.1]` |
| Divider | `dark:divide-white/[0.07]` |
| Accent | `indigo-*` (replaced `blue-*` structural accents) |

## Preserved Semantic Colors

The following colors were NOT changed per the zero-logic-change contract:

- **emerald** — safety ALLOW / creative mode on / live status badges
- **red** — safety BLOCK / drift warning states
- **amber** — safety ESCALATE / creative mode warning / proposal amber badges
- **OpenClaw-blue** (`blue-100/700/300/900/40`) — OpenClaw source identifiers in ProposalsTable
- **Toggle inactive** (`dark:bg-gray-700`) — OpenClaw toggle disabled icon bg
- **Policy radio dot inactive** (`dark:bg-gray-600`) — KernelPolicySelector inactive radio
- **Hover border inactive** (`dark:hover:border-gray-600`) — KernelPolicySelector inactive hover border
- **Risk matrix category colors** — CRITICAL (red), HIGH (orange), MEDIUM (amber) badge colors
- **Governance checker state badges** — pre-existing semantic purple/blue/orange

---

## Governance Page: Active Tab Contrast Fix

Original restyling set both the tab strip and active tab to `dark:bg-[#1a1d2e]`, making the selected tab invisible. Fixed by using `dark:bg-white/[0.1]` for the active tab surface, which creates visible lift above the `dark:bg-[#1a1d2e]` strip background.

---

## Safety Page: Multi-Edit Recovery

The initial multi_edit encountered two overlap conflicts:
- Chunk `dark:bg-gray-800` (replace_all) conflicted with prior single `dark:bg-gray-800/60` chunk
- Chunk `dark:border-gray-700` (replace_all) conflicted with prior `dark:border-gray-700/50` chunk (prefix substring overlap)

Recovery: four targeted replace_all edits applied sequentially post-conflict, resolving all remaining `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:border-gray-700`, `dark:bg-gray-900`, and `dark:border-gray-600` instances. Final grep verified zero remaining old tokens.

## Zero-Logic-Change Verification

- No function signatures changed
- No hooks added or removed
- No props added or removed
- No routing or navigation wiring changed
- No click handlers or form submission paths changed
- No API route files touched
- No test files touched
- No `layout.tsx` touched
- No `middleware.ts`, `auth.ts`, or package config touched

---

## Tier A Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `tsc --noEmit` | ✅ Exit 0, no errors |
| `eslint` (6 target files, `--max-warnings=0`) | ✅ Exit 0, no new warnings |
| `next build` | ✅ Exit 0, all routes static |

Pre-existing lint warnings (aria-expanded in SidebarNavGroup, nested controls in TemplateCard, accessibility attrs in UserContext/AIUsagePanel/Settings, inline styles in AIUsagePanel) — all pre-W109 issues, unchanged, 0 new.

## Test Delta

**Expected:** 0  
**Actual:** 0 — CSS-only changes, no logic paths, no test surface modified.
