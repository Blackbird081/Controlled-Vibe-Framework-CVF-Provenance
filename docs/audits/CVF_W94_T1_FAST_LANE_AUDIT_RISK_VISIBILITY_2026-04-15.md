## 1. Proposal

**What is being done:**
Add a visible R0/R1/R2/R3 risk badge to ProcessingScreen.tsx so non-coder users see the risk classification produced by the enforcement layer for their request — without needing to open any admin or governance screen.

**Files to be changed:**
- `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/components/ProcessingScreen.tsx` (+~30 lines)
- `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/components/ProcessingScreen.test.tsx` (+~50 lines)
- New: `docs/assessments/CVF_W94_T1_POST_RUN_QUALITY_ASSESSMENT_2026-04-15.md`
- New: `docs/baselines/archive/CVF_GC026_TRACKER_SYNC_W94_T1_CLOSED_2026-04-15.md`

**Governance reuse:**
- Risk labels from `safety-status.ts` (SafetyRiskLevel, getSafetyStatus, RISK_LABELS, RISK_DESCRIPTIONS) — no new vocabulary invented
- Risk values from `enforcement.riskGate.riskLevel` in the execute response — no new risk evaluation logic

---

## 2. Eligibility Check

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| 1. No new governance policy defined or modified? | YES |
| 2. No new risk classifications introduced? | YES — reuses R0/R1/R2/R3 from safety-status.ts |
| 3. No frozen baseline files modified? | YES — v1.0/, v1.1/, doctrine/ untouched |
| 4. Change is additive (no deletion of governance controls)? | YES |
| 5. Scope is bounded — single component + test file? | YES |
| 6. Existing tests remain green after change? | YES — verified by test run |
| 7. Change is observable and verifiable by visual inspection? | YES — data-testid="risk-badge" |

All 7 YES — Fast Lane eligible.

## 3. Scope

**In scope:**
- Extract `enforcement.riskGate.riskLevel` from the `/api/execute` response in ProcessingScreen
- Map R4 → R3 for display safety-status.ts compatibility
- Render badge with `data-testid="risk-badge"`: emoji + level code + label + description
- Badge visible for ALL enforcement states (BLOCK, NEEDS_APPROVAL, CLARIFY) and briefly during success (300ms before onComplete)
- Unit tests for badge rendering in W94-T1 describe block

**Out of scope:**
- Changing `onComplete` interface or any wizard component
- Adding risk badge to the output display area (would require touching 9 wizard files)
- Modifying governance policy or risk evaluation logic
- Connecting knowledge-native stack to `/api/execute` (architecture gap from W93-T1)

---

## 4. Why Fast Lane Is Safe

1. **Pure display change** — no enforcement logic modified. Risk levels are read-only from the existing enforcement response.
2. **Existing risk vocabulary** — reuses `SafetyRiskLevel`, `getSafetyStatus()`, `RISK_LABELS`, `RISK_DESCRIPTIONS` from `safety-status.ts`. Zero new risk semantics.
3. **Additive only** — adds state variable, two reads, and badge JSX. Existing paths unchanged.
4. **No interface break** — `onComplete: (output: string) => void` signature unchanged. No wizard files modified.
5. **Testable** — `data-testid="risk-badge"` allows deterministic assertions.
6. **GC-023 safe** — ProcessingScreen.tsx goes from 423 → ~455 lines (under 700 advisory). Test file goes from 304 → ~355 lines (under 800 advisory).

---

## 5. Verification

- [ ] `npm run test:run` — all tests pass (including new W94-T1 describe block)
- [ ] `npm run lint` — max-warnings=0 clean
- [ ] `tsc --noEmit` — no type errors
- [ ] Visual: risk badge renders in ProcessingScreen during enforcement states
- [ ] data-testid="risk-badge" present and contains risk level label + description

---

## 6. Audit Decision

**FAST LANE READY**

All 7 eligibility checks pass. Change is bounded, additive, reuses existing governance vocabulary, and is fully verifiable by test + visual inspection.

---

## 7. Notes

- Gate 5 measurement standard §9 requires: visible R0/R1/R2/R3 + minimal label + minimal explanation, no separate governance screen needed.
- Badge is most valuable in enforcement states (BLOCK, NEEDS_APPROVAL) where governance intervention is relevant.
- For success path: badge shows during the 300ms transition window. Non-coder sees it before output replaces ProcessingScreen.
- Architecture gap (W93-T1): knowledge-native stack not wired into execute path. Remains open. This tranche does not address it.
- Next tranche after W94-T1: GC-026 roadmap §TIER 3 / W95.
