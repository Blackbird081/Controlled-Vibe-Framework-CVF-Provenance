# CVF Agent Handoff V16 - Active Session Continuity

Memory class: POINTER_RECORD

Status: ACTIVE HANDOFF

Date opened: 2026-06-06

Supersedes: `CVF_SESSION/handoffs/archive/AGENT_HANDOFF_V15_2026-05-29.md`

## Purpose

This handoff is the active compact continuity file for resumed CVF agents after
V15 exceeded the governed hard line-count threshold during MLW8-PEL1 closure.

## Scope / Target / Owner Boundary

Target:

- active startup routing;
- latest mode and next allowed move;
- bounded closure state for LE1 after MLW8-PEL1;
- handoff rotation evidence.

Owner boundary:

- this file is a pointer record only;
- detailed historical continuity remains in archived V15 and prior archived
  handoffs;
- implementation, tests, reviews, and evidence remain in their governed owner
  paths.

## Startup Acknowledgment

Startup acknowledged: current mode=`le1_live_e2e_selector_flow_diagnostic_closed_pass_bounded`; active handoff=`AGENT_HANDOFF_V16_2026-06-06.md`; next allowed move=stop for review or open a fresh separately authorized GC-018/work order for the next product/governance tranche; parked checkpoint=none.

## Current Mode

`le1_live_e2e_selector_flow_diagnostic_closed_pass_bounded`

Current HEAD recorded for this handoff: `8a6cb0565c223c14a1794ba2c92c132d861f654a`
(LE1 material commit; this handoff sync records closure continuity).

## Active Boundary

Active handoff: `AGENT_HANDOFF_V16_2026-06-06.md`.

Archived predecessor:
`CVF_SESSION/handoffs/archive/AGENT_HANDOFF_V15_2026-05-29.md`.

Remote tracking branch: origin/main

Exact remote SHA must be derived live from git when needed — not
hand-maintained as a moving target.

External agent memory files: non-canonical convenience only.

Only V16 should be treated as the active root handoff.

## Latest Work / Changes

- Opened V16 compact handoff.
- Rotated V15 into the handoff archive.
- Recorded MLW8-PEL1 bounded diagnostic closure and public-safe export evidence.
- Closed LE1 live E2E selector/test-flow diagnostic with focused live
  Playwright PASS and full release gate PASS.
- Classified V16 as an `INTERNAL_ONLY` visible root file for P3/public exposure
  guard compatibility.
- Preserved next allowed move as stop for review or a fresh separately
  authorized GC-018/work order.

## Latest Continuity Note

LE1 Live E2E Selector Flow Diagnostic is `CLOSED_PASS_BOUNDED`.

Private artifacts:

- GC-018: `docs/baselines/CVF_GC018_LE1_LIVE_E2E_SELECTOR_FLOW_DIAGNOSTIC_2026-06-06.md`
- Work order: `docs/work_orders/CVF_WO_LE1_LIVE_E2E_SELECTOR_FLOW_DIAGNOSTIC_2026-06-06.md`
- Helper: `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/tests/e2e/utils.ts`
- Completion: `docs/reviews/CVF_LE1_LIVE_E2E_SELECTOR_FLOW_DIAGNOSTIC_COMPLETION_2026-06-06.md`

- Release gate result: `docs/evidence/CVF_LE1_RELEASE_GATE_RESULT_2026-06-06.json`
- Diagnostic: `docs/evidence/CVF_LE1_RELEASE_GATE_DIAGNOSTIC_2026-06-06.json`

Public-safe export:

- Public-sync for LE1: not authorized.
- Public Export Disposition: `DEFERRED_PRIVATE_ONLY`
- Prior MLW8-PEL1 public-safe export remains at public-sync commit `d97f38c08`.

Verification summary:

- LE1 material commit: `8a6cb056`.
- Root-file exposure registry sync commit: `7da248a0`.
- Closure scope-evidence alignment commit: `3c19148c`.
- Public catalog boundary note commit: `ca069392`.
- Pre-dispatch autorun gate: PASS.
- Pre-implementation autorun gate: PASS.
- Web TypeScript check: PASS.
- Focused live Playwright final run: PASS, 8 expected, 1 skipped,
  0 unexpected, 0 flaky.
- Secret-value evidence check: PASS; raw Alibaba/DashScope/service token values
  were not found in LE1 evidence files.
- Full release gate command was run with live credentials.
- Release gate result: PASS for build, guard-contract typecheck, provider
  readiness, secrets scan, docs governance, mock E2E, and live Playwright
  governance.

Predecessor MLW8-PEL1 remains historically:

- MLW8-PEL1 helper focused tests: PASS, 3 files / 13 tests.
- Web TypeScript check: PASS.
- MLW8-PEL1 release gate result: build, guard-contract typecheck, provider
  readiness, secrets scan, docs governance, and mock E2E PASS; live Playwright
  governance E2E FAIL on `locator.click` timeouts.

Diagnostic boundary:

- LE1 may claim local private release-gate live governance E2E pass after
  bounded test-flow repair.
- Do not claim public readiness, hosted readiness, production readiness,
  cost reduction, performance improvement, provider superiority, or MLW8
  automatic optimization from LE1.

## Next Allowed Move

Stop for review or open a fresh, separately authorized GC-018/work order for
the next product/governance tranche.

LHW24 remains the latest closed numbered LHW wave in
`CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_SESSION_STATE.json`; this MLW8-PEL1 tranche does not alter
the LHW sequence.

Blocked without separate authorization and passing phase gates:

- automatic optimization;
- prompt/context mutation;
- policy relaxation or evidence reduction;
- provider routing change;
- public/hosted/production readiness claim;
- cost/performance/provider-quality claim;
- memory reinjection;
- high-risk promotion implementation;
- Learning Orchestrator runtime behavior;
- autonomous mutation.

## Required First Reads

1. `CVF_SESSION_MEMORY.md`
2. `CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_SESSION_STATE.json`
3. `CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_REVIEW_QUEUE.json`
4. `AGENT_HANDOFF_V16_2026-06-06.md`
5. Mandatory standards named in `AGENTS.md`

## Core Guard Self-Protection Authorization

Authorized guard-maintenance scope: rotate active handoff from V15 to V16 after
V15 exceeded the governed hard line-count threshold during MLW8-PEL1 closure
sync.

Protected paths:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CVF_SESSION/ACTIVE_SESSION_STATE.json`
- `CVF_SESSION_MEMORY.md`
- `AGENT_HANDOFF_V16_2026-06-06.md`
- `CVF_SESSION/handoffs/archive/AGENT_HANDOFF_V15_2026-05-29.md`

Operator authorization: 2026-06-06 operator authorized Codex to complete the
MLW8 proof/export/live tranche without further questions. Handoff rotation is
required guard remediation inside the tranche closure scope.

Rollback boundary: if this sync is wrong, restore only active-handoff pointers
and V16/V15 placement. Do not revert unrelated operator or workspace changes.

## Claim Boundary

This handoff is a routing and continuity artifact. It does not prove runtime
behavior, provider behavior, public readiness, hosted readiness, production
readiness, or hidden cross-agent memory transfer.
