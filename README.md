## Front-Door Path

Use the root front door in this order:

1. `README.md` for role-based triage and current posture
2. `START_HERE.md` for the shortest audience-routed redirect
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the system-shape view before deeper internal references

If you want the deeper private-core chain after that, use [Docs Index](docs/INDEX.md).

If you need the current canonical continuation posture after `W54-T1`, use:

- [Agent Instructions](AGENTS.md)
- [Agent Handoff](AGENT_HANDOFF.md)
- [Whitepaper Progress Tracker](docs/reference/CVF_WHITEPAPER_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)
- [Master Architecture Closure Roadmap](docs/roadmaps/CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_CLOSURE_ROADMAP_2026-04-05.md)
- [New Machine Setup Checklist](docs/reference/CVF_NEW_MACHINE_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md)

## Mandatory Live Governance Proof

Release-quality CVF governance proof — evidence that CVF classified, routed, allowed or blocked, and recorded a real AI/provider call — must use real provider API calls. Mock mode is valid only for UI structure checks such as navigation, routing, static badge rendering, and RBAC pages.

Use this command before publishing any claim that CVF controls AI/agent behavior for non-coders:

```bash
python scripts/run_cvf_release_gate_bundle.py --json
```

The gate runs UI-only mock E2E plus live governance E2E, and it must fail if no DashScope-compatible live key is available. `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` is accepted directly; `ALIBABA_API_KEY`, `CVF_ALIBABA_API_KEY`, and `CVF_BENCHMARK_ALIBABA_KEY` are accepted aliases. `--e2e` is a targeted UI-only check, not governance evidence.

## Current Live-Proof Boundary

> Current live proof: Alibaba/DashScope is the primary certified release lane, with W149 proving the 40-form trusted corpus through direct API and browser UI journeys and W152 preserving a `7/7` release gate PASS. DeepSeek is a certified provider lane with canary evidence and W149 confirmatory subset coverage (`12/12`), but full provider parity is not claimed. Other providers may have adapter contracts or experimental integration surfaces, but they are not certified until their own live canary receipts are saved.

## What CVF Is

CVF is a governance-first control plane — a layer that decides whether an AI call may run, which provider lane it uses, and what evidence is recorded — for AI-assisted execution.

CVF solves three problems in AI-assisted development: uncontrolled provider costs, ungoverned agent execution, and lack of verifiable audit trails. Without CVF, agents can call providers without budget enforcement, leak or repeat sensitive content in outputs, and leave weak evidence of what ran. CVF puts a governed control plane between your code and your AI providers.

Its active reference path is built around one canonical controlled loop:

`INTAKE -> DESIGN -> BUILD -> REVIEW -> FREEZE`

Intake — the step where CVF captures the request, context, risk signals, and policy constraints before execution — starts that loop.

What CVF is good at:

- keeping human approval — a person or policy checkpoint before sensitive work proceeds — and audit evidence inside the delivery loop
- enforcing phase, role, risk, scope, and mutation boundaries — the practical rules that decide what an agent may do, when, and under whose authority
- giving both coder-facing and non-coder paths a governed execution model
- keeping provider choice user-owned while routing, policy, and evidence stay CVF-governed
- preserving reconciliation records so future audits are faster and cheaper

## What CVF Can Publicly Claim Today

The strongest public-safe claim CVF can make right now is:

- **on one validated provider lane, CVF has proven real non-coder value**
- **across two live provider lanes, CVF has proven multi-provider operability**
- **the trusted-form web front door is live-usable across the current 40-form non-wizard corpus**
- the governed path preserves normal-task usefulness
- risky requests are blocked or guided instead of left as prompt roulette
- `NEEDS_APPROVAL` is no longer a dead end
- risk visibility and follow-up rounds now exist in the main non-coder flow
- knowledge-native context — project/domain knowledge injected into the governed request path — now improves live `/api/execute` outcomes, not just governance docs
- absorbed CVF ADD doctrine is runtime-readable in the external-asset governance lane, with registry persistence, operator UI readout, and metadata query filters
- the Web processing/result flow now visibly shows and exports governance evidence receipts per request (decision, risk, provider/model, routing, policy snapshot, envelope/receipt id, knowledge source, approval id when present)
- the Web Governance Operations console can run allowlisted local governance jobs with redacted job receipts and local cost/quota preflight before live provider calls
- downstream workspace adoption is repeatable across at least 3 project kinds with a scripted proof path
- a workspace-to-web evidence bridge links downstream enforcement proof to CVF Web live evidence without distributing API keys
- W119 proves one bounded first-use adoption journey: first governed output, project knowledge use, and evidence handoff all passed live on the Alibaba lane

Public-safe product wording:

> CVF helps non-coders use AI through a governed path that is safer, clearer, and more reliable than unguided prompting.

Boundaries that still matter:

- one-provider non-coder value is proven on the Alibaba lane
- multi-provider operability is proven on Alibaba `qwen-turbo` and DeepSeek `deepseek-chat`
- W149 proved the full trusted-form corpus on Alibaba direct API `40/40`, Alibaba browser UI `40/40`, and a DeepSeek confirmatory subset `12/12`
- provider speed, strength, reliability, and cost remain provider-lane economics chosen by the user
- the public `Skill Library` front door is now synced to a governed subset, but benchmark truth still comes only from the `GC-044` trusted subset

Canonical claim boundary:

- [Live Evidence Publication Packet](docs/reference/CVF_LIVE_EVIDENCE_PUBLICATION_PACKET_2026-04-21.md)
- [Public Non-Coder Value Statement](docs/reference/CVF_PUBLIC_NONCODER_VALUE_STATEMENT_2026-04-17.md)
- [Provider Lane Readiness Matrix](docs/reference/CVF_PROVIDER_LANE_READINESS_MATRIX.md)
- [Alibaba live canary receipts](docs/audits/alibaba-canary/INDEX.md)
- [DeepSeek live canary receipts](docs/audits/deepseek-canary/INDEX.md)

## Core Value: Governed AI For Non-Coders

CVF is building toward a governed provider hub. The currently proven product value is now two-layered:

- **CVF gives non-coders a governed AI path**
- **CVF can run that governed path across more than one live provider lane**
- provider choice may evolve, but governance, risk handling, approval flow — the rules that decide whether an AI call is allowed to proceed based on budget, role permission, and policy match — and evidence discipline remain CVF-owned
- provider speed, model strength, latency, and cost are lane-specific tradeoffs, not CVF architecture blockers

Long-term hub direction:

- users can enable the provider keys they actually want to use
- CVF keeps routing, policy, trace capture, and evidence discipline consistent across those providers
- provider choice stays flexible, while governance stays centralized

What CVF is not claiming today:

- full parity across every provider lane
- identical speed, quality, latency, or cost across provider lanes
- universal quality across every legacy skill or template in the current web library
- fully unified controlled autonomy on every channel
- platform breadth comparable to larger orchestration ecosystems

The safest current product claim is recorded in [Release Readiness](docs/reference/CVF_RELEASE_READINESS_STATUS_2026-03-20.md).

For a visual system map, open [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Developer Technical Design

Yes. CVF already has a technical design / architecture set for developers. The shortest path is:

The public architecture front door is intentionally diagram-first: it keeps the
module relationship map, dependency-layer map, active reference path, and
interaction sequence visible before deeper prose. Start with
[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) when you need to see how CVF modules connect.

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Fast module overview and system shape | [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Canonical module map and layer vocabulary | [Architecture Map](docs/reference/CVF_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) |
| Diagram-first architecture view | [Architecture Diagrams](docs/reference/CVF_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md) |
| Ecosystem-level structure | [Ecosystem Architecture](CVF_ECOSYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Deep closure-assessed architecture baseline | [Master Architecture Whitepaper](docs/reference/CVF_MASTER_ARCHITECTURE_WHITEPAPER.md) |
| Public APIs and external-asset governance metadata | [Reference API Docs](docs/reference/api/README.md) and [External Asset Governance API Contract](docs/reference/CVF_W67_T1_EXTERNAL_ASSET_GOVERNANCE_API_CONTRACT.md) |

The application is organized around these practical modules:

| Module | Main path | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| Web / non-coder app | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/` | dashboard UI, intent routing, trusted forms, `/api/execute`, provider settings, evidence display/export |
| Trusted form routing | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/lib/form-routing.ts` + `trusted-form-corpus.ts` | maps non-coder prompts into the 40-form trusted corpus without changing wizard behavior |
| External asset governance | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/lib/server/external-asset-governance.ts` | bounded intake — review before CVF admits outside knowledge or capabilities — before registry admission |
| CVF ADD runtime metadata | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/lib/cvf-add-runtime-doctrine.ts` | server-derived capability, boundary, context-profile, delegation, and provider-boundary metadata |
| Governed asset registry | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/src/lib/server/asset-registry.ts` | append-only registry persistence and queryable runtime readout |
| Guard contract | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_GUARD_CONTRACT/` | shared guard semantics, policy/risk contract, public SDK boundary |
| Governance runtime | `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL/` | canonical phase/governance orchestration primitives |
| Governance compatibility gates | `governance/compat/` + `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/` | local/CI checks that block drift between docs, tests, guards, retention, and release posture |
| Workspace bootstrap | `scripts/new-cvf-workspace.ps1` + `docs/reference/CVF_WORKSPACE_RULES.md` | downstream project isolation and generated agent-enforcement artifacts |

For new developers, read in this order: `README.md` -> `ARCHITECTURE.md` -> `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web/README.md` -> the specific module listed above.

## Start Here

Choose the shortest path for your role:

| Role | Best Starting Point |
|---|---|
| New reader / General evaluator | [Getting Started](docs/GET_STARTED.md) and [Quick Orientation](docs/guides/CVF_QUICK_ORIENTATION.md) |
| Builder / Integrator | [Controlled Execution Loop](docs/concepts/controlled-execution-loop.md) and [Reference Governed Loop](docs/reference/CVF_REFERENCE_GOVERNED_LOOP.md) |
| Non-coder / Operator | [Getting Started](docs/GET_STARTED.md) and [Non-Coder Governed Packet](docs/reference/CVF_NONCODER_REFERENCE_GOVERNED_PACKET.md) |

### Quick Run: Web UI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blackbird081/Controlled-Vibe-Framework-CVF.git
cd Controlled-Vibe-Framework-CVF/EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.6_AGENT_PLATFORM/cvf-web
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

Provider proof note: the current certified release lane is Alibaba/DashScope; DeepSeek has certified canary evidence and bounded confirmatory coverage, but CVF does not claim provider parity. See [Current Live-Proof Boundary](#current-live-proof-boundary).

In `Settings`, enable the provider keys you want to use. Each admitted `provider + model` pair is treated as a governed run lane for future Product Value Validation.

Operators can use `http://localhost:3000/governance/operations` for allowlisted governance jobs, including the Web-triggered full live release gate. Live jobs are guarded by the local cost/quota policy at `.cvf/config/cost-quota-policy.json` and append local audit records under `.cvf/runtime/`; these files are local-first and are not a cloud control plane.

For a guided RC first-run path on Windows, use the [CVF 5-Minute RC Setup](docs/guides/CVF_5_MINUTE_RC_SETUP.md):

```bash
python scripts/cvf_setup.py --write-env --json
```

For Netlify, Vercel, and Docker posture, see the [CVF Deploy Guide](docs/guides/CVF_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md).

### Quick Run: Workspace Bootstrap

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\new-cvf-workspace.ps1 `
  -WorkspaceRoot "D:\CVF-Workspace" `
  -ProjectName "My-Project"
```

See [Workspace Isolation Guard](governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/CVF_WORKSPACE_ISOLATION_GUARD.md).
See [CVF Workspace Rules](docs/reference/CVF_WORKSPACE_RULES.md) for the canonical parent-folder layout: workspace root, hidden `.Controlled-Vibe-Framework-CVF` governance clone, and sibling downstream application folders.

Current boundary: this bootstrap is now `agent-enforcement-ready` when the generated downstream `AGENTS.md`, `.cvf/` policy manifests, workspace-root `WORKSPACE_RULES.md`, bootstrap log, and workspace doctor checks are present. See [W112-T1 Workspace Agent Enforcement and Web Control Uplift](docs/roadmaps/CVF_W112_T1_WORKSPACE_AGENT_ENFORCEMENT_AND_WEB_CONTROL_UPLIFT_ROADMAP_2026-04-22.md).

Downstream proof: [W113-T1](docs/roadmaps/CVF_W113_T1_FIRST_DOWNSTREAM_PROJECT_PROOF_ROADMAP_2026-04-22.md) proved the first downstream adoption path. [W114-CP7](docs/assessments/CVF_W114_T1_MULTI_SAMPLE_DOWNSTREAM_PROOF_2026-04-23.md) extended this to 3 sample projects across cli-productivity, web-app-planning, and data-analysis — all doctor 11/11 PASS, all tests pass, sample 3 includes a secret-free bridge to live Web evidence.

### Moving To A New Machine

Use [New Machine Setup Checklist](docs/reference/CVF_NEW_MACHINE_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md).
The default CVF rule is: clone first, then install only inside the extension you are actively using.
Use `npm ci` when that package already has `package-lock.json`; otherwise use `npm install`.

### New Machine Quick Start

Fresh clone, one extension only:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blackbird081/Controlled-Vibe-Framework-CVF.git
cd Controlled-Vibe-Framework-CVF/EXTENSIONS/<target-extension>
npm ci   # if package-lock.json exists
# or: npm install   # if that package has no lockfile
```

If you need all 4 foundations ready at once, use:

```powershell
.\scripts\bootstrap_foundations.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap_foundations.sh
```

For hosting and deployment options after local setup, use the [CVF Deploy Guide](docs/guides/CVF_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md).

## Current Status

Current posture on the active reference path:

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Architecture baseline | `v3.7-W46T1 CLOSURE-ASSESSED` |

Read this status as:

- the MC1-MC5 architecture baseline is complete and CLOSURE-ASSESSED
- the one-provider governed path now has evidence-backed non-coder value
- the multi-provider path now has evidence-backed live operability on Alibaba and DeepSeek
- the knowledge-native execute path now has live benefit evidence after `W101-T1` + `W102-T1`
- the post-closure integration wave is no longer docs-only; a bounded runnable governance surface now exists in `cvf-web`
- the CVF ADD absorption wave is now runtime-readable in the external-asset governance lane, but does not execute external tools or widen provider behavior
- the trusted-form web front door is live-usable on the current 40-form corpus under the W149 evidence boundary
- the latest verified local baseline is CPF `2999`, EPF `1301`, GEF `625`, LPF `1493`, and `cvf-web` `2027`
- the active path has no open tranche and remains `SUBSTANTIALLY DELIVERED`
- Web is live-proven on its active governed AI path, but it should not be described as fully inheriting every CVF runtime/module
- workspace bootstrap now isolates downstream work and generates downstream agent-enforcement artifacts
- downstream adoption proof is workspace-proven across three sample kinds through W114 CP7, with a secret-free bridge to live Web evidence
- W114 is closed delivered: non-coder benefit is more visible, repeatable, and evidence-backed across Web and downstream workspaces within the stated claim boundaries
- W114 CP4 now adds compact live outcome evidence: 19/19 expected decisions, 12/12 useful allowed outputs, 5/5 guided high-risk blocks, 3/3 knowledge hits, 2/2 follow-up refinements, and 2/2 approval artifacts
- W114 CP5 now makes the main Web processing flow display route-returned governance evidence
- W114 CP6 now lets downstream workspaces generate a secret-free bridge receipt linking workspace doctor proof to CVF Web live evidence
- W114 CP7 now proves the downstream adoption pattern is repeatable across 3 tested project kinds (cli-productivity, web-app-planning, data-analysis): all doctor 11/11, all tests pass, sample 3 includes a secret-free bridge to live Web evidence — multi-sample proof script: `scripts/w114_cp7_multi_sample_downstream_proof.ps1`
- W114 CP1-CP8 complete; public evidence packet: `docs/reference/CVF_W114_PUBLIC_EVIDENCE_PACKET_2026-04-23.md`
- W119 is closed delivered: one realistic non-coder adoption journey is now live-proven end-to-end with first-run readiness, knowledge-assisted execution, visible/exportable evidence receipt, and no raw-key leakage in evidence artifacts.
- W119 live evidence pack: 3/3 locked journeys passed; 3/3 expected decisions; 3/3 evidence receipts; 3 accepted knowledge chunks; 3/3 useful live outputs; raw provider keys not printed.
- relocation is closed-by-default; next work should follow the Post-MC5 Continuation Strategy
- future expansion must go through scan continuity review, reassessment, or a fresh bounded `GC-018`

### Public Skill Library Truth Boundary

The public web `Skill Library` is now a **governed front-door subset explorer**.

That means:

- front-door discovery only shows `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF` and `REVIEW_REQUIRED` surfaces
- legacy/reject/unscreened surfaces are quarantined from front-door discovery
- raw visible counts still must not be treated as proof that every visible skill is benchmark-trusted
- benchmark truth and public-value proof remain bound to `TRUSTED_FOR_VALUE_PROOF`

The governing authorities for public-value proof remain:

- [Template / Skill Corpus Rescreen Standard](docs/reference/CVF_TEMPLATE_SKILL_CORPUS_RESCREEN_STANDARD_2026-04-14.md)
- [Corpus Rescreen D2 Matrix](docs/baselines/CVF_CORPUS_RESCREEN_D2_MATRIX_2026-04-15.md)
- [Corpus Rescreen D3 Trusted Subset](docs/baselines/CVF_CORPUS_RESCREEN_D3_TRUSTED_SUBSET_2026-04-15.md)

### Newly Runnable Upgrade Surface

The post-closure additions from `CVF ADDING NEW` and `Windows_Skill_Normalization` now have a bounded executable inheritance path in `cvf-web`:

- `POST /api/governance/external-assets/prepare`
- flow: `external intake -> semantic classification -> planner heuristics -> provisional signal -> W7 normalization -> registry-ready preparation`
- optional Windows compatibility review
- intentionally separate from `/api/execute` and the paused provider-lane PVV stream

This is the current proof that the upgrade wave is not only canon/docs work anymore.

The newer CVF ADD runtime activation makes absorbed doctrine server-readable and registry-persisted in the same external-asset governance lane. It adds capability/boundary/context/delegation/provider-boundary metadata, operator UI readout, and metadata query filters. It intentionally does not execute external tools, bypass `/api/execute` governance, or claim full runtime inheritance.

## Governance & Evidence

CVF treats governance as an executable system — code, tests, and release checks that enforce policy instead of only describing it — not just documentation. Critical controls now have explicit owners such as:

- runtime guard — code that checks a request while the system is running
- gateway precondition — a required condition before an API/provider call may enter the governed path
- approval checkpoint — a human or policy review stop before sensitive work continues
- CI compatibility gate — automated repository checks that block drift before merge or release
- governance decision gate — the rule checkpoint that returns `ALLOW`, `NEEDS_APPROVAL`, or `BLOCK`
- foundational guard surface gate — a repository-level check that protects the core governance files from accidental unsynchronized changes

The authoritative mapping lives in [CVF_GOVERNANCE_CONTROL_MATRIX.md](docs/reference/CVF_GOVERNANCE_CONTROL_MATRIX.md).

Important current continuity controls:

- `GC-020` keeps pause/resume and agent transfer truthful through governed handoff and phase-bounded context continuity
- `GC-020` records the tracked remote branch in handoff; exact remote SHA must be derived live from git when needed rather than hand-maintained as a moving target
- `GC-021` allows `Fast Lane` for low-risk additive work inside an already-authorized tranche
- `GC-022` classifies durable memory records as `FULL_RECORD`, `SUMMARY_RECORD`, or `POINTER_RECORD` so future memory stays useful without over-recording
- `GC-032` requires governed artifact writing to stay source-truth-first, keep typed evidence explicit, and move continuity surfaces together when tranche posture changes
- `GC-045` requires new governed Markdown files to include the structural sections required by their artifact type, enforced by `CVF_MARKDOWN_STRUCTURAL_COMPLETENESS_GUARD.md`

Foundational governance surfaces that used to depend mainly on reviewer discipline are now also blocked by `governance/compat/check_foundational_guard_surfaces.py`, covering ADR updates, architecture-baseline refresh, extension naming, structural audit packets, test-depth reporting, and workspace isolation.

For future roadmap deepening:

- active-wave continuation is gated by `GC-018`
- continuation is not default-open after closure
- substantive active-path expansion must carry an explicit scored packet before implementation

For contributor attribution and AI collaboration roles, see
[Contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md).

For extension authors and public contributors, start with
[CVF Extension Author Boundary](docs/reference/CVF_EXTENSION_AUTHOR_BOUNDARY.md).
It explains where to add trusted forms, provider lanes, skills, and governance
guards, plus which surfaces require explicit authorization.

For substantive changes:

1. update the affected code or docs
2. add the required baseline or review artifact
3. run the governance compatibility gates
4. keep claims truthful to the current baseline

Helpful entrypoints:
