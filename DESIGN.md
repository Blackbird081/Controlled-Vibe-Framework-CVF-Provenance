# CVF DESIGN.md

Canonical UI/UX design system for Controlled Vibe Framework products.

This file is the design contract for coding agents. External design repos,
brand-inspired DESIGN.md files, screenshots, and prototypes are reference
material only. CVF remains the source of truth.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

CVF interfaces should feel like a professional command workspace: precise,
calm, structured, and operational. The UI must help users make decisions,
run workflows, and inspect evidence without feeling like a marketing page.

Primary qualities:
- Premium but not decorative
- Dense enough for real work, never cluttered
- Clear hierarchy before visual effects
- Data, state, actions, and review gates are first-class UI
- Dark-primary by default, with readable light support when required

Avoid:
- Generic AI gradients, glowing blobs, and decorative orbs
- Landing-page hero treatment inside operational apps
- Random brand mimicry from external references
- One-off page styling that breaks system consistency

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Core Dark System

| Role | Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shell | `--cvf-bg-shell` | `#0d0f1a` | App sidebar, outer chrome |
| Page | `--cvf-bg-page` | `#111218` | Main content background |
| Surface | `--cvf-surface` | `#1c1d27` | Cards, panels, tables |
| Surface elevated | `--cvf-surface-elevated` | `#242636` | Active panels, drawers |
| Border | `--cvf-border` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` | Dividers, card outlines |
| Border strong | `--cvf-border-strong` | `rgba(255,255,255,0.14)` | Active/focus boundaries |
| Text primary | `--cvf-text-primary` | `#f4f7fb` | Main text, headings |
| Text secondary | `--cvf-text-secondary` | `#a3adc2` | Body support text |
| Text muted | `--cvf-text-muted` | `#6f7890` | Metadata, placeholders |

### Accent & Semantic Roles

| Role | Token | Value | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary accent | `--cvf-accent` | `#5b5cf6` | Primary actions, active nav, focus |
| Accent soft | `--cvf-accent-soft` | `rgba(91,92,246,0.14)` | Active backgrounds, subtle highlights |
| Success | `--cvf-success` | `#10b981` | Pass, connected, completed |
| Warning | `--cvf-warning` | `#f59e0b` | Pending, caution |
| Danger | `--cvf-danger` | `#f43f5e` | Error, destructive, blocked |
| Info | `--cvf-info` | `#38bdf8` | Neutral system info |

Rules:
- Use one primary accent per product surface unless a domain brand requires a
  controlled override.
- Semantic colors must communicate state, not decoration.
- External reference palettes may inspire a variant, but must be remapped to
  CVF roles before implementation.

## 3. Typography Rules

Preferred font stack:
- UI sans: `DM Sans`, `Inter`, system sans
- Technical mono: `DM Mono`, `ui-monospace`, `SFMono-Regular`, `Menlo`

Hierarchy:

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page title | 24-26px | 700 | 1.15 | Operational, compact |
| Section title | 13-14px | 600 | 1.3 | Use for panels and grouped controls |
| Body / table | 12-13.5px | 400-500 | 1.45-1.65 | Dense but readable |
| Metadata label | 9-11px | 700 | 1.2 | Uppercase, letter-spaced |
| KPI number | 26-34px | 700 | 1.0 | Tabular if possible |
| Button text | 11-12px | 500-600 | 1.2 | Concise action labels |

Rules:
- Use letter spacing only for uppercase metadata labels.
- Do not scale font size directly with viewport width.
- Prefer compact operational clarity over oversized marketing type.

## 4. Layout & Navigation

### App Shell

Default product shell:
- Fixed left sidebar: 220px desktop baseline
- Topbar/action strip: 44-52px
- Scrollable content region
- Clear page title, status, and primary action area

Sidebar pattern:
- Logo/product block
- User/workspace block
- Grouped navigation with uppercase group labels
- Footer actions such as settings, language, logout
- Active item uses accent-soft background, bright text, and optional 5px dot

### Page Rhythm

| Element | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Page padding | 24-32px |
| Section spacing | 18-24px |
| Card gap | 10-16px |
| Card padding | 16-20px |
| Panel radius | 12-14px |
| Control radius | 7-9px |

Dashboard order:
1. Header/action strip
2. KPI or stat strip
3. Primary chart/table/workflow area
4. Secondary detail panels
5. Activity, evidence, or audit trail

Form workflow order:
1. Context and preserved constraints
2. Required fields
3. Advanced fields
4. Review gate
5. Primary action and recovery state

## 5. Component Styling

### Cards & Panels

- Background: `--cvf-surface`
- Border: 1px `--cvf-border`
- Radius: 12-14px
- Padding: 16-20px
- Hover: border shifts toward accent alpha, translateY(-1px to -2px)
- Do not nest cards inside cards unless repeated items require clear grouping.

### KPI / Stat Cards

- Label: uppercase, 10-11px, muted
- Value: 26px+, bold, tabular where possible
- Icon pill: 28-32px, semantic/accent alpha background
- Optional trend/status line: 11px, concise

### Filters & Search

- Filter bar has its own surface and border.
- Search height: 36px, radius 9px, icon left.
- Pills: radius 999px only for filters/tags, not primary buttons.
- Active pill: accent background; inactive pill: tab alpha background.

### Buttons

| Type | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | Solid accent, white text |
| Soft | Accent alpha background, accent text |
| Outline | Transparent with accent/border alpha |
| Ghost | Transparent, hover surface |
| Danger | Danger color only for destructive actions |

Rules:
- Use icons for tool buttons when the meaning is familiar.
- Keep button labels short.
- Avoid oversized rounded text pills for commands.

### Tables & Dense Data

- Preserve row scanability over decorative styling.
- Use sticky headers only when table height warrants it.
- Align numeric values consistently.
- Empty, loading, and error states must occupy the table area rather than
  appearing as disconnected notices.

### Empty / Loading / Error

- Empty: explain the next useful action.
- Loading: skeleton or muted progress, never a blank wait.
- Error: plain-language cause, recovery action, and trace/evidence if useful.

## 6. Depth, Motion & Feedback

Depth:
- Prefer thin alpha borders and restrained shadows.
- Use elevation to clarify interaction or containment, not decoration.

Motion:
- Hover transitions: 120-180ms
- Page/card reveal: fade + translateY(6-8px), 180-240ms
- Hover lift: max 2px
- Respect reduced-motion preferences.

Focus:
- Keyboard focus must remain visible.
- Focus treatment should use accent border/ring without large glows.

## 7. Responsive Behavior

Breakpoints are implementation-specific, but behavior must follow:
- Mobile: single column, no horizontal scroll, touch targets at least 44px
- Tablet: preserve primary workflows, collapse secondary panels earlier
- Desktop: use grid density carefully; do not stretch content beyond readability
- Data tables: provide horizontal containment or responsive column strategy

Mobile priority:
1. Primary action
2. Current status
3. Required inputs or top data
4. Secondary filters/details

## 8. Accessibility & Language

- Maintain readable contrast in both dark and light modes.
- Do not use color alone to communicate status.
- All controls need accessible labels.
- Vietnamese UI must stay natural and short.
- Avoid technical jargon in non-coder surfaces.
- Error and approval messages must explain what the user can do next.

## 9. Agent Prompt Guide

When building or redesigning a CVF web surface, agents must:

1. Use this `DESIGN.md` as the canonical visual system.
2. Preserve existing routes, auth, APIs, data contracts, stores, parsers, and
   integrations unless the user explicitly approves runtime changes.
3. Generate or follow a handoff packet before making broad UI changes.
4. Apply CVF visual DNA through existing project components and tokens first.
5. Avoid importing new UI libraries unless explicitly approved.
6. Validate desktop, tablet, mobile, keyboard focus, loading, empty, and error
   states before delivery.

Default handoff sections:
1. Website Goal
2. Target Users
3. Required Pages and Flows
4. CVF Web Redesign DNA
5. UX / Visual Direction
6. Protected Constraints
7. Agent Build Instructions
8. Acceptance Checklist

Do not invent concrete endpoint paths, database fields, auth mechanisms, or
route names that the user did not provide. State protected scope instead.

## 10. Reference Absorption Policy

External design references are allowed only as inspiration.

Absorb:
- Layout archetypes
- Component recipes
- Typography relationships
- Spacing rhythm
- State handling
- Useful anti-patterns

Do not absorb:
- Brand identity as-is
- Proprietary visual signatures
- Decorative trends that weaken usability
- Conflicting token systems
- Duplicate skills that overlap the CVF canonical UI/UX skill

CVF skill library rule:
- Keep UI/UX skills few and strong.
- Prefer one canonical system skill, one prototype-ingest skill, and one QA
  checklist over many overlapping design skills.

Promotion rule:

- A reusable design lesson — whether from an external reference **or from an
  internal upgrade, audit, or fix** — may update `DESIGN.md` when it improves
  reusable design judgment across CVF products. Continuous enrichment after each
  upgrade is expected; the gate is that it goes through this rule, not around it.
- A reference pattern may update `product_ux/cvf_web_ux_redesign_system` when it
  changes how agents should produce web design DNA or implementation guardrails.
- A reference pattern may update `product_ux/claude_design_handoff` when it
  changes how agents extract value from prototypes or generated HTML.
- A new UI/UX skill is allowed only when the capability is recurring,
  non-overlapping, and cannot be expressed as a rule in the canonical system
  skill or QA checklist.

Destination + evidence (do not reinvent — CVF already standardizes this):
- Where a lesson goes is decided by `SKILL_PORTFOLIO_CANONICALIZATION_POLICY`
  §7 Promotion Decision (whole-domain judgment → `DESIGN.md` or canonical skill;
  intake → handoff skill; quality check → QA skill; one-off → project handoff;
  duplicate → reject). Merge-first (§5); a new skill is the last option.
- Any audit/review/fix artifact that records design findings must carry a
  `## Finding-To-Governance Learning Disposition` section per
  `docs/reference/CVF_FINDING_TO_GOVERNANCE_LEARNING_TRIGGER_STANDARD_2026-05-29.md`
  (machine-enforced) and a §13 intake note when a reference was absorbed.
- This keeps the design enrichment loop a special case of the CVF-wide
  finding-to-learning loop, not a parallel standard.

## 11. Canonical UI/UX Skill Portfolio

Use a small active portfolio for web UI/UX work:

| Role | Canonical Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System design | `product_ux/cvf_web_ux_redesign_system` | Converts product intent, page type, and reference material into CVF-native web design DNA and implementation guardrails. |
| Prototype ingestion | `product_ux/claude_design_handoff` | Extracts useful structure, motion, component recipes, and visual intent from Claude Design or other prototypes without copying brand identity. |
| Pre-delivery QA | `app_development/ui_pre_delivery_checklist` plus accessibility/heuristic checks when needed | Verifies responsive behavior, focus, loading, empty/error states, a11y, and DESIGN.md conformance before ship. |

Do not create a new UI/UX skill for palette generation, typography pairing,
style selection, generic frontend design, or dark/light audit unless it
introduces a genuinely new capability that cannot live inside the canonical
system skill or QA checklist.

## 12. Style Vocabulary

Agents may choose a CVF style mode from this vocabulary, then adapt it to the
product domain. A style mode is not a brand clone; it is a design recipe.

### Enterprise Dashboard

Use for SaaS admin, reporting, operations, CRM, finance, logistics, and
internal tooling.

- Layout: left sidebar, dense topbar, KPI strip, table/chart split, audit rail
- Surfaces: dark-primary panels, crisp borders, low shadow
- Typography: compact headings, tabular metrics, readable 12-14px data text
- Visual focus: state, filters, evidence, fast scanning
- Avoid: oversized hero sections, decorative cards, soft consumer styling

### Developer SaaS

Use for tools, APIs, agent consoles, documentation dashboards, and technical
workflows.

- Layout: clean shell, command/search bar, code blocks, status badges
- Surfaces: restrained monochrome or dark chrome with one accent
- Typography: sans for UI, mono for IDs, logs, snippets, and metadata
- Visual focus: precision, hierarchy, inspectability
- Avoid: noisy gradients, novelty icons, vague marketing blocks

### Premium Landing

Use for public product pages, product launches, service websites, and portfolio
surfaces.

- Layout: first-viewport product signal, full-bleed real/generated visual,
  clear CTA, next section visible
- Surfaces: spacious sections, strong imagery, restrained cards
- Typography: larger editorial heading, concise supporting copy
- Visual focus: trust, offer clarity, proof, conversion path
- Avoid: split hero cards, generic gradient-only hero, empty feature claims

### Ops / Industrial

Use for logistics, ports, factories, field operations, warehouse, maintenance,
and safety workflows.

- Layout: operational shell, shift/status strip, queue/table priority, alerts
- Surfaces: sturdy dark or neutral surfaces with strong state colors
- Typography: clear labels, bold numbers, short Vietnamese/ops copy
- Visual focus: current state, exceptions, handoff, accountable actions
- Avoid: playful motion, decorative imagery, ambiguous soft colors

### Consumer Friendly

Use for simple consumer apps, booking, food, wellness, education, and onboarding
flows.

- Layout: fewer controls per view, guided steps, clear primary action
- Surfaces: lighter or warmer palette variants mapped back to CVF tokens
- Typography: slightly more generous line-height and section spacing
- Visual focus: reassurance, clarity, reduced cognitive load
- Avoid: enterprise density, jargon, excessive settings-first screens

Selection rule:
- If the product is used repeatedly for work, start from Enterprise Dashboard
  or Ops / Industrial.
- If the product sells or explains something publicly, start from Premium
  Landing.
- If the product is a tool for builders, start from Developer SaaS.
- If the user explicitly names a mood, map the mood into one of these modes
  and state the tradeoff in the handoff packet.

## 13. Design Reference Intake Gate

Use this gate before absorbing any external design repository, `DESIGN.md`
collection, inspiration gallery, generated prototype, screenshot set, or UI
prompt pack into CVF.

### Intake Classification

Classify the source before reading it deeply:

- Design corpus: useful for style vocabulary, layout patterns, and component
  behavior.
- Component library: useful for interaction states, density, accessibility, and
  token structure.
- Production app or screenshot: useful for workflow hierarchy and information
  architecture.
- Brand clone or trend pack: useful only for contrast and anti-patterns unless
  it contains reusable product logic.
- Prompt/spec repository: useful for agent instructions, acceptance criteria,
  and handoff structure.

### Hard Rejects

Do not absorb a reference if it requires:

- copying brand identity, proprietary visual signatures, logos, names, or exact
  compositions
- replacing CVF tokens with an unrelated token system
- adding a new UI/UX skill that duplicates the canonical portfolio
- prioritizing decoration over task clarity, accessibility, or maintainability
- weakening non-coder handoff clarity
- adding framework or package dependencies only for visual style
- preserving source-specific licensing or attribution claims CVF cannot satisfy

### Quality Score

Promote only patterns that pass all five checks:

| Check | Required Question |
| --- | --- |
| Product fit | Does it improve a real CVF user workflow, not only visual taste? |
| Reusability | Can it serve more than one project, page type, or domain? |
| Governability | Can an agent apply it from written rules without copying source assets? |
| Accessibility | Does it preserve contrast, focus states, responsive layout, and readable density? |
| Skill hygiene | Does it enrich an existing canonical skill instead of creating overlap? |

### Absorption Output

For each accepted source, write a short intake note with:

1. Source name and URL/path
2. What was absorbed
3. What was rejected
4. Which CVF surface changed: `DESIGN.md`, a canonical skill, QA checklist, or a
   one-off project handoff
5. Why no duplicate skill was created

`awesome-design-md` is treated as a design-reference corpus: absorb useful
design-contract patterns, vocabulary, and agent-facing acceptance criteria; do
not import it as a competing skill library.

## 14. Theming, Elevation & Token Discipline

Promoted from the PolicyLocal UI audit (2026-06-10). These are reusable design
judgments that apply to every CVF web surface, not one project. They sharpen
§2, §6, and §8 with concrete, enforceable rules.

### 14.1 Token-first is non-negotiable

A raw color hex or `rgba()` literal inside a component is a defect, not a style
choice. The two failure modes it causes have both happened in CVF products:

- **Light mode silently breaks.** A page hard-coded to dark hex (e.g. a landing
  page at `#080910`) ignores `[data-theme="light"]` and stays dark while the
  rest of the app flips. Every color must come from a token that is defined in
  **both** the `:root` (dark) and `[data-theme="light"]` blocks.
- **The accent becomes a dead feature.** A primary button glowing with a literal
  `rgba(91,92,246,…)` will not follow a user accent change.

Only allowed literals: brand gradient stops, and pure-white inset-shadow
hairlines used identically in both themes.

### 14.2 No pure black, no flat single-tone surface

Base backgrounds are deep blue-charcoal (`#0d0f1a` shell, `#0b0d16` for
public/landing base), never `#000`. Pure black plus one uniform fill reads as
low-effort and is fatiguing.

Long pages and landing surfaces must use **tonal banding**: alternate a base
band and a slightly raised band so the eye gets rhythm. The boundary is a soft
inset hairline plus a faint accent glow line, never a hard 1px divider. The
final CTA band may carry a radial accent glow at top-center as the visual
climax. Banding tokens must flip with `[data-theme]` like everything else.

### 14.3 Layered elevation scale

§6 says "restrained shadows" — this is the concrete scale. Each level is an
ambient (soft, wide) + key (tight) shadow + a hairline ring, and is re-tuned
lighter and blue-tinted for light mode. Never a single hard black blob.

| Level | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `xs` | hairline separation |
| `sm` | resting card |
| `md` | hover / raised card |
| `lg` | list-row hover, popover, drawer |
| `xl` | modal / dialog |

Primary-button hover and focus pops use an accent-tinted glow shadow derived
from the active accent, so depth recolors with the accent.

### 14.4 Accent as an app-wide variable

One primary accent per surface (§2), but the accent is a **swappable token set**,
not a fixed color. Implement it so the full set (`accent`, hover, soft, border,
on-tint text, glow, gradient) is redefined under `[data-accent="<name>"]` on the
theme root. Every component built on `var(--accent*)` then recolors for free.

Adding an accent is exactly three edits — a `[data-accent]` block (plus a
light-mode text tweak for readability), one entry in the accent type/union, and
one swatch in the settings UI. If a multi-accent capability is declared in code
but has no CSS blocks and no picker UI, it is a dead feature; wire all three or
remove the declaration.

### 14.5 Implementation pitfalls (recurring)

- **Inline border that toggles on a boolean:** build the full `border` shorthand
  in one expression — `border: '1px solid ' + (on ? a : b)`. Mixing the `border`
  shorthand and a separate `borderColor` in the same inline object triggers
  React's "Updating a style property during rerender" console error.
- **Orphan routes:** every reachable surface needs a real path to it. A public
  or landing page with no link from the app shell (e.g. the logo not linking
  home/landing) is a navigation defect, not just a polish gap.
- **IDE "inline styles" warnings** are expected where a codebase styles via
  inline objects; the real gate is the project linter at zero warnings, not the
  IDE hint.

### 14.6 Pre-ship verification (adds to §8)

Before claiming a UI change done, verify in **all three** of: dark theme, light
theme, and a non-default accent (e.g. teal). A change that only looks right in
dark+indigo is unverified. Screenshots must be inspected, not assumed —
an invisible surface or vanished text in one combination is a failure.
