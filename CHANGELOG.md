# CHANGELOG — Controlled Vibe Framework (CVF)

---

## [v4.0.0] — GA Release — 2026-05-16

Status: GA_LOCAL_FIRST_APPROVED

### Summary

CVF 4.0.0 is the first Generally Available release of the local-first governance
control plane. It ships post-RC2 stability work, EA infrastructure tracks A–E,
three Web Integration tranches (T1–T3), and a complete Quality Benchmark Suite
methodology. The GA decision is bounded: local-first operability is proven;
output-quality parity with direct providers is not claimed.

### What shipped since v4.0.0-rc.1

#### Web Integration — Tranches 1, 2, 3 (end-user discovery surface)

- **Knowledge Intake** (`/knowledge/intake`): governed knowledge packet submission
  with visible source, audience, and review boundary — bilingual EN/VI.
- **Artifact Export** (`/artifacts`): governed HTML review packet generation.
  Claim upgraded to **governed artifact generation** — confirmed 2026-05-16:
  `POST /api/artifacts/export` returns a live `governanceReceipt`
  (`decision: ALLOW`, `riskLevel: R0`) when the governance engine is configured.
- **Work Transfer** (`/work-transfer`): audit-history review and governed HTML
  artifact export for handover or review.
- **Sidebar navigation**: all three routes wired from first login (T1).
- **Home page quick-action cards** (T3): Knowledge Intake (emerald) and
  Artifact Export (indigo) cards on the post-login home screen — bilingual EN/VI.
- **Landing page governed-workflows callout** (T3): three-column callout linking
  to all three governed routes — bilingual EN/VI.
- **Public README Web Workflows section** (T3): route table with descriptions,
  discoverable by evaluators before login.

Evidence: `docs/reviews/CVF_WEB_INTEGRATION_TRANCHE_3_CLOSURE_2026-05-16.md`

#### EA Enhancement Tracks A–E

- **Track A** — Governance Tax Measurement instrumentation.
- **Track B** — QBS Benchmark Dashboard tab in `/governance`.
- **Track C** — Audit Receipt Integrity model with SHA-256 manifest.
- **Track D** — Provider Policy Engine with preference tiers and failover.
- **Track E** — DLP Quality Benchmark with synthetic corpus.

Evidence: `docs/evidence/cvf-16-5-runtime-absorption.md`; 76 tests pass.

#### Post-RC2 GA Readiness

- 6/6 baseline regression streams closed (BR).
- 11/11 cost/quota cases closed (CQ).
- DeepSeek N=8 smoke/sanity confirmed.
- Hosted CI2-H 7/7 PASS (GitHub Actions run `25575296660`).

Evidence: `docs/evidence/local-first-release-gate-proof-2026-05-16.md`

#### Quality Benchmark Suite (QBS)

- Methodology and run artifacts are public.
- Alibaba/DashScope R10 checkpoint preregistered.
- No public QBS quality score is claimed until a powered run and reviewer
  scoring are published.

Evidence: `docs/benchmark/README.md`

#### CVF 16.5 knowledge absorption

- Knowledge Intake, Artifact Export, Work Transfer, and Change Handoff surfaces
  hardened for non-coder use.
- Nine governed runtime contracts adopted (controlled memory, tool call trace,
  agent boundary delegation, MCP business adapter, observability delta signal,
  knowledge vault intake, document artifact renderer, OpenSpec change adapter,
  governed skill evolution loop).

#### Infrastructure

- GC-045 Markdown Structural Completeness Guard added and enforced.
- GC-023 File Size Guard wired in `.githooks/pre-commit`.
- Public surface scanner (`scripts/check_public_surface.py`) added.
- Provider lanes: Alibaba/DashScope 7/7 release gate PASS;
  DeepSeek and OpenAI canary receipts 6/6 PASS.

### Claim boundary

- `GA_LOCAL_FIRST_APPROVED`: local-first operability with live provider lanes proven.
- Not claimed: output-quality parity with direct providers, multi-tenant cloud
  quota enforcement, full DeepSeek regression confirmation.
- Artifact Export "governed artifact generation" claim requires the governance
  engine to be configured; without it, the export produces HTML structure only.

## [v4.0.0-rc.1] — Public Release Candidate Tag Binding

Date: 2026-05-08

### Added
- Public RC tag binding for `v4.0.0-rc.1`.
- Release notes draft: `docs/reference/CVF_RELEASE_NOTES_V4_0_0_RC_1_2026-05-08.md`.
- WPR-1 contributor boundary: `docs/reference/CVF_EXTENSION_AUTHOR_BOUNDARY.md`.
- WPR-2 deploy guide: `docs/guides/CVF_DEPLOY_GUIDE.md`.
- WPR-3 exposure audit: `docs/reviews/CVF_PUBLIC_EXPOSURE_AUDIT_2026-05-08.md`.

### Verified
- Release gate PASS 7/7: Web build, TypeScript guard contract, provider readiness, secrets scan, docs governance, UI mock Playwright, and live governance Playwright.
- W149 trusted-form corpus evidence remains the live value baseline: Alibaba direct API 40/40, Alibaba browser UI 40/40, DeepSeek confirmatory 12/12.
- RC truth remains bounded by `docs/reference/CVF_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TRUTH_PACKET_2026-04-21.md` and `docs/reference/CVF_KNOWN_LIMITATIONS_REGISTER_2026-04-21.md`.

### Boundary
- This is a release candidate, not GA.
- No runtime behavior, provider behavior, deploy config, governance policy, or trusted-form corpus changed in WPR-4.
- GitHub Release publication remains operator/CLI-token dependent; the in-repo release notes are the canonical draft.

---

## [2026-03-06] — CVF v1.1.1 Phase Governance Protocol Integrated

### Added
- **CVF v1.1.1 Phase Governance Protocol** — `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.1.1_PHASE_GOVERNANCE_PROTOCOL/`
  - **Layer 1.5 (Development Governance)** — NEW layer between Core and Tools
  - 9-stage deterministic pipeline: SPEC→STATE_MACHINE→STATE_DIAGRAM→IMPLEMENTATION→STATE_VALIDATION→UNIT_TESTING→SCENARIO_SIMULATION→PHASE_GATE→COMPLETE
  - 7 sub-modules: phase_protocol, phase_gate, state_enforcement, diagram_validation, structural_diff, scenario_simulator, reports
  - 21 TypeScript files
- **ADR-014** — Phase Governance Protocol integration decision

### Fixed (during integration)
- `scenario.generator.ts` — added MAX_SCENARIOS=100, MAX_DEPTH=50, cycle-safe DFS
- `mermaid.parser.ts` — added `toStateMachine()` converter for data structure compatibility
- `gate.result.ts` — added R0–R3 canonical risk level mapping

---

## [2026-03-05] — CVF_Layer AI Stack Integrated (v1.8.1 + v1.7.3 update + tools/)

### Added
- **CVF v1.8.1 Adaptive Observability Runtime** — `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.8.1_ADAPTIVE_OBSERVABILITY_RUNTIME/`
  - **Adaptive Governance**: Risk-based enforcement feedback loop (normal/moderate/strict/block)
  - **Observability**: 10 modules — telemetry, satisfaction, cost, regression, health, A/B testing
  - **Storage**: metrics.store, audit.store, snapshot.store
  - **UI Dashboards**: risk, skill analytics, cost, security audit
  - **SDK**: cvf.client.ts + integration.hooks.ts
- **Edge Security** merged into v1.7.3 Runtime Adapter Hub — PII detector, secret detector, injection precheck, vault + rehydration
- **Skill Security Scanner** — `tools/skill_security_scanner/` — pre-install static security analysis (behavior chain, obfuscation, base64 decode, prompt injection)
- **ADR-013** — CVF_Layer AI Stack refactoring decision: tách compound system thành 3 đích đến

### Architecture decisions
- CVF_Layer AI Stack = compound system (3 repos + 1 layer) → refactored into 3 đích đến:
  - Adaptive + Observability (tight coupling) → v1.8.1 (sub-extension of v1.8, Layer 2.5+3)
  - Edge Security → merge vào v1.7.3 (natural extension, Layer 5)
  - Security Scanner → tools/ (Layer 2 static analysis tool)
- Không tạo v3.0 — áp dụng Decision Framework: chưa đủ scope cho MAJOR version mới
- `CVF_Layer AI Stack/` folder at root sẽ bị xóa sau khi tích hợp xong

---

## [2026-03-05] — v1.2.2 Skill Governance Engine Integrated

### Added
- **CVF v1.2.2 Skill Governance Engine** — `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.2.2_SKILL_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE/`
  - **Skill Spec Schema (CSS-1.0)**: Chuẩn hóa toàn bộ skills với R0–R3 canonical mapping, evaluation block bắt buộc, maturity lifecycle
  - **Constitution Layer**: 5 CVF Rules STRICT, `constitution.ts` — không component nào được bypass
  - **Governance Kernel**: Risk threshold evaluation (≤70 = approve), integrity check, skill verification
  - **Phase Manager** (với Governance Gate): Phase transition bị block nếu không pass GovernanceKernel
  - **Skill Fusion Intelligence**: Multi-factor ranking (semantic 35% + historical 20% + maturity 15% − risk 15% − cost 15%)
  - **Evolution Engine** (Acontext-style): Execution trace → Pattern distill → Dynamic skill → Probation → Governance approve
  - **Internal Ledger**: skill_usage, risk_decision, dynamic_promotion, execution_trace logs
  - **Policy System**: global.policy.yaml + domain.policy.yaml + risk.matrix.yaml + cost.control.policy.yaml
  - **Maturity Model**: EXPERIMENTAL → PROBATION (5+ runs, 70% success) → STABLE (20+ runs, 85% success) → DEPRECATED
- **ADR-012** — Versioning Decision Framework (3 criteria: Scope / Dependency / User Impact) + v1.2.2 integration rationale
- **Decision Framework**: Permanent rule: "MỞ VERSION MỚI khi scope hoàn toàn mới. MỞ RỘNG LAYER CŨ khi là natural extension." Prevents version sprawl.

### Fixed (During Integration)
- Risk threshold conflict: `global.policy.yaml` aligned to 70 (matches `governance.kernel.ts`)
- Phase Manager: Added `GovernanceKernel.evaluate()` gate for GOVERNANCE_DECISION / EXECUTION / LEDGER_RECORD phases
- `skill.schema.yaml`: Added mandatory `evaluation` block (success_metrics, failure_conditions, rollback_strategy)
- `skill.schema.yaml`: Added `risk_r_level` enum (R0–R3) with numeric mapping documentation
- `TREEVIEW.md`: Removed duplicate `/fusion` reference — now only exists under `/skill_system/fusion/`

### Architecture decisions
- v1.2.2 is sub-extension of v1.2 (Skill Governance) — same domain, NOT a new MAJOR/MINOR version
- Layer 2 (Tools) — technical governance tooling, not UI/UX layer
- `CVF_Skill Specification/` folder at root replaced by `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.2.2_SKILL_GOVERNANCE_ENGINE/`
- Dynamic skills never auto-approved (probation required) — consistent with CVF safety-over-speed principle

---

## [2026-03-05] — v1.8/v1.9/v2.0 Governance Specs Integrated + Extension Rules

### Added
- **CVF v1.8 Safety Hardening** spec — `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.8_SAFETY_HARDENING/`
  - 7-phase execution state machine (INTENT→COMMIT), strictly enforced
  - Deterministic Mutation Sandbox + Mandatory Rollback Manager
  - Governance Brain: Risk formula, Mutation Budget, Escalation Tiers (L0–L3)
  - Behavior Drift Monitor + Stability Index (self-regulating autonomy)
  - TypeScript implementation treeview (future code target)
- **CVF v1.9 Deterministic Reproducibility** spec — `EXTENSIONS/CVF_v1.9_DETERMINISTIC_REPRODUCIBILITY/`
  - ExecutionRecord (9-field immutable record per execution)

  - Intent Interpreter (human language → kernel policy mapping)
  - Builds on v1.7.2 Dashboard + v1.7.3 Adapter Hub
- **ADR-010** — Kernel Integration Strategy (v1.7.1 vs v1.8) + version placement decisions
- **`governance/compat/risk_level_mapping.md`** — Canonical R0–R3 ↔ numeric score mapping
- **CVF Extension Rules (R1/R2/R3)** — Mandatory governance for all future CVF additions
  - R1: Existing structure is always standard
  - R2: Additions must be compatible and additive
  - R3: Naming must follow CVF conventions
- **Architecture Check Guard** — `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/CVF_ARCHITECTURE_CHECK_GUARD.md`
- **CVF_CORE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md** — Permanent governance reference at `docs/`

### Changed
- `docs/CVF_CORE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` — Added v1.8/v1.9/v2.0 to Section II (Layer 2.5) and Section III (version table). Added Section XIV (CVF Extension Rules).
- `README.md` — Added Architecture Check Rule + CVF Extension Rules in governance section
- `docs/CVF_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` — Added ADR-010

### Architecture decisions
- v1.8 is a refinement of v1.7.1 (not replacement) — same Layer 2.5, starts from v1.7.1 codebase
- v1.9 is purely additive on top of v1.8 (no v1.8 components changed)
- v2.0 extends v1.7.2 + v1.7.3 at Layer 4/5 (does not bypass kernel)
- All v1.8→v2.0 content at Spec level — code implementation is future scope

- **BUG-012** — v1.7.3 typecheck failure (added `@types/node` + DOM lib)
- **BUG-013** — Risk model drift risk (fixed by implementing `build-risk-models.js` to auto-generate TS definitions during build)
- **BUG-014** — README quality snapshot outdated (updated to 2026-02-28)
- **BUG-015** — 24 lint errors and build typecheck crashes across Web UI (resolved `no-explicit-any`, `set-state-in-effect`, introduced `OpenClawResultData`)
