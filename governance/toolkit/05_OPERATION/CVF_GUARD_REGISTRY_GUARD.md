# CVF Guard Registry Guard

**Guard Class:** `META_GUARD`
**Status:** Active mandatory discoverability rule for governance guard surfaces.
**Applies to:** All humans and AI agents creating, renaming, deleting, or materially revising guard files in `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/`.
**Enforced by:** `governance/compat/check_guard_registry.py`

## Purpose

- keep every active guard discoverable from the repo front door
- prevent orphaned guard files that exist on disk but are invisible in README or the knowledge base
- ensure guard creation and maintenance stay synchronized with the human-readable guard index

## Rule

When a guard file is created, renamed, deleted, or materially revised in `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/`, the same change batch MUST keep registration truthful in both of these locations:

- `README.md`
- `docs/CVF_CORE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`

Minimum registration checklist:

1. the guard file exists with its final filename
2. the filename appears in `README.md`
3. the filename appears in `docs/CVF_CORE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
4. `README.md` links to the guard registry and operation toolkit instead of
   duplicating the full guard filename table
4. registration changes ship in the same commit batch as the guard change

This registry rule governs discoverability only. It complements, but does not replace, the stronger guard authoring contract in `GC-030`.

## Enforcement Surface

- repo-level enforcement runs through `governance/compat/check_guard_registry.py`
- local pre-push enforcement runs through `governance/compat/run_local_governance_hook_chain.py`
- CI enforcement runs through `.github/workflows/documentation-testing.yml`

The registry gate intentionally checks the complete on-disk guard inventory instead of trusting a hand-maintained count inside this document.

- `docs/CVF_CORE_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`
- `governance/toolkit/05_OPERATION/CVF_GUARD_AUTHORING_STANDARD_GUARD.md`
- `governance/compat/check_guard_registry.py`

## Final Clause

A guard that cannot be discovered cannot be relied on.

Registration is the minimum truth layer for every guard: if a worker cannot find it from the repo front door, governance has already drifted.
