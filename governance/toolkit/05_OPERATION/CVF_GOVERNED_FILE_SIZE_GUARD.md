# CVF Governed File Size Guard

**Control ID:** `GC-023`
**Guard Class:** `SIZE_AND_OWNERSHIP_GUARD`
**Status:** Active global maintainability boundary for governed source, test, frontend, and active markdown files.
**Applies to:** governed source, test, frontend, and active markdown files across CVF, excluding surfaces that already have their own dedicated rotation or archive guards.
**Enforced by:** `governance/compat/check_governed_file_size.py`

## Purpose

- keep governed files reviewable by humans
- preserve split-by-responsibility discipline across waves and tranches
- stop oversized files from growing through silent drift instead of intentional exception tracking

Some CVF artifacts already use dedicated rotation or archive controls, such as:

- `docs/CVF_INCREMENTAL_TEST_LOG.md`
- governed conformance trace logs
- governed Python automation covered by `check_python_automation_size.py`
  (class-aware per-class thresholds for `python_checker`, `python_test`,
  `python_library_helper`, and `python_cli_orchestrator`, wired into the local
  hook chain and the autorun `pre-implementation` phase as of GFS-PY-T1)

`GC-023` covers the remaining governed file surface that would otherwise lack a global maintainability boundary.

## Rule

Large governed files are allowed only when one of these conditions is true:

1. the file stays below the active hard threshold for its class
2. the file has an approved exception entry with explicit rationale and follow-up

Default operating rule:

- split before the file becomes a maintenance liability
- do not keep adding new tranche logic into an already oversized file without an exception trail
- preserve exceptions as tracked debt, never as silent drift
- if a governed file is touched while it is within 25 lines of its hard
  threshold, the same batch must rotate/split into a new file in the same
  maintainability domain or shrink the touched file by at least 50 lines
- if governed source, test, frontend, or active markdown is added or modified
  inside a registered owner domain while its active owner entrypoint is within
  25 lines of the hard threshold, the same batch must also split/rotate or
  meaningfully shrink that owner entrypoint; leaving the owner untouched is not
  a valid bypass
- active front doors and handoffs should open a new pointer/archive/successor
  file instead of compressing prose to pass the line-count guard

### File Classes And Thresholds

#### `test_code`

Applies to:

- `*.test.ts`
- `*.test.tsx`
- `*.test.js`
- `*.test.jsx`
- files under `/tests/`

Thresholds:

- advisory threshold: `> 800` lines
- hard threshold: `> 1200` lines

#### `frontend_component`

Applies to:

- `*.tsx`
- `*.jsx`
- excluding test files

Thresholds:

- advisory threshold: `> 700` lines
- hard threshold: `> 1000` lines

#### `general_source`

Applies to:

- `*.ts`
- `*.js`
- excluding tests and frontend components

Thresholds:

- advisory threshold: `> 700` lines
- hard threshold: `> 1000` lines

#### `active_markdown`

Applies to:

- non-archived markdown intended for active reading or governed execution reference

Thresholds:

- advisory threshold: `> 900` lines
- hard threshold: `> 1200` lines

### Exclusions

This guard does not govern files already controlled by dedicated rotation or archive rules:

- `docs/CVF_INCREMENTAL_TEST_LOG.md`
- `docs/logs/**`
- any path containing `/archive/`
- `docs/reviews/cvf_phase_governance/logs/**`
- governed Python automation already covered by `check_python_automation_size.py`

These exclusions exist to avoid double-enforcement and conflicting thresholds.

### Required Workflow

When a governed file exceeds the hard threshold:

1. split the file by responsibility, scope, or tranche, or
2. add an approved exception entry to `governance/compat/CVF_GOVERNED_FILE_SIZE_EXCEPTION_REGISTRY.json`
3. include rationale, approved maximum, and required follow-up split plan
4. run `python governance/compat/check_governed_file_size.py --enforce`

If a file is already above threshold and is touched in a new batch:

- prefer reducing or extracting from it in the same batch
- do not append new tranche logic into the oversized file unless the exception still truthfully covers that usage

If a file is near the hard threshold and is touched in a new batch:

1. rotate, archive, or split the file before adding more continuity or feature
   content;
2. keep the active entrypoint as a pointer file when the artifact is a front
   door or handoff;
3. record the new archive/successor path in the active state or handoff when
   applicable;
4. run `python governance/compat/check_governed_file_size.py --enforce`.

Shortening wording just enough to stay under the hard threshold is not an
acceptable primary remediation for near-threshold active files.

If adjacent governed changes enter a registered owner domain while its active
entrypoint is near the hard threshold:

1. include the owner entrypoint in the same batch;
2. split, rotate, archive, or shrink the owner by at least 50 lines;
3. do not mark the owner as forbidden-touch to avoid cleanup;
4. record the owner surface under `proactiveOwnerSurfaces` in
   `governance/compat/CVF_GOVERNED_FILE_SIZE_EXCEPTION_REGISTRY.json`;
5. include `domainFileClasses` when the owner domain covers non-code governed
   files such as `active_markdown`;
6. run `python governance/compat/check_governed_file_size.py --enforce`.

### Exception Model

Approved exceptions are allowed only for:

- legacy debt already present before the guard
- temporary compatibility surfaces
- deliberate monoliths that are being phased out or actively split

Each exception must declare:

- file path
- file class
- approved maximum lines
- status
- rationale
- required follow-up

Exception entries are governance debt records, not blanket approvals.

## Enforcement Surface

- repo-level enforcement runs through `governance/compat/check_governed_file_size.py`
- local pre-commit and pre-push enforcement runs through `governance/compat/run_local_governance_hook_chain.py`
- exception trail integrity is paired with `governance/compat/check_governed_exception_registry.py`
- CI enforcement runs through `.github/workflows/documentation-testing.yml`

Strict command:

```bash
python governance/compat/check_governed_file_size.py --enforce
```

Violations include:

- a governed file exceeding its hard threshold without approved exception
- a file exceeding its exception maximum
- an incomplete exception entry
- growing an oversized file without maintaining the exception trail
- touching a near-hard-threshold governed file without a same-domain
  rotation/split artifact or meaningful size reduction
- adding or modifying adjacent governed files in a registered near-hard owner
  domain while leaving the owner entrypoint untouched

## Final Clause

CVF does not require every file to be tiny.

CVF does require every large governed file to be intentional, reviewable, justified, and on a path toward cleaner ownership.
