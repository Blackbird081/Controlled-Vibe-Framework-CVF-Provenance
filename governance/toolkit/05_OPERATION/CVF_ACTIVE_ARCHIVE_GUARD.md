# CVF Active Archive Guard

**Guard Class:** `DOCS_AND_MEMORY_HYGIENE_GUARD`
**Status:** Active archive-maintenance contract for dated operational documents.
**Applies to:** Managed roots such as `docs/` and `ECOSYSTEM/strategy/` plus their local `archive/` subdirectories.
**Enforced by:** `scripts/cvf_active_archive.py`, `governance/compat/check_active_archive_hygiene.py`, `governance/compat/check_active_window_registry.py`, `governance/compat/check_audit_retention_registry.py`, `governance/compat/check_review_retention_registry.py`, `governance/compat/CVF_ACTIVE_WINDOW_REGISTRY.json`, `governance/compat/CVF_ACTIVE_ARCHIVE_BASELINE.json`, `governance/compat/CVF_AUDIT_RETENTION_REGISTRY.json`, `governance/compat/CVF_REVIEW_RETENTION_REGISTRY.json`

## Purpose

- keep working directories focused on current data
- separate active documents from historical archives without losing auditability
- prevent archive moves that silently break live references or baseline anchors

## Rule

Maintain clean active zones for dated operational artifacts while preserving truthful archives.

### Scope

This guard applies to managed roots:

| Root | Content Type |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | full CVF docs tree including reference, reviews, roadmaps, baselines, guides, concepts, and support docs |
| `ECOSYSTEM/strategy/` | strategic docs, roadmaps, and evaluation reports |

Policy overlap control:

- paths that already have dedicated rotation guards are excluded from this guard, such as `docs/logs/` and `docs/reviews/cvf_phase_governance/logs/`
- canonical active windows owned by dedicated rotation guards are never auto-archived by this generic cleanup flow and must be registered in `governance/compat/CVF_ACTIVE_WINDOW_REGISTRY.json`
- archive folders (`*/archive/`) are never re-scanned as active candidates
- `docs/audits/` uses stricter retention classification through `governance/compat/CVF_AUDIT_RETENTION_REGISTRY.json`

### File Naming Rule

Files intended for automated active/archive rotation MUST include a date suffix in the filename.

Required pattern:

```text
CVF_<DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

Examples:

- `CVF_INDEPENDENT_EXPERT_ASSESSMENT_2026-03-09.md`
- `CVF_ROADMAP_FIXES_2026-03-10.md`

Non-compliant examples:

- `CVF_ROADMAP_NANG_CAP.md`
- `assessment_final_v2.md`

### Active Zone

- only files with a date suffix are eligible for auto-archive
- dated files in the last 5 calendar days stay active
- dated files older than 5 days become archive candidates and then pass screening rules before move
- non-dated files are treated as evergreen docs and remain active unless explicitly refactored

### Archive Zone

Each local doc area keeps a sibling `archive/` subdirectory. Only candidates that pass impact screening are moved:

- no protected-reference dependency
- no high inbound reference risk from active docs
- no live markdown-link dependency from active docs
- no dedicated-rotation overlap

`CVF_ARCHIVE_INDEX.md` is auto-generated or updated for each archive folder.

### Permanent Files

The following files are never archived:

- `README.md` in any managed directory
- `CVF_STRATEGIC_SUMMARY.md`
- `CVF_UNIFIED_ROADMAP_2026.md`
- `CVF_WHITEPAPER_COMPLETION_ROADMAP_2026-03-21.md`
- `CVF_SYSTEM_UNIFICATION_REMEDIATION_ROADMAP_2026-03-19.md`
- canonical active windows owned by dedicated rotation guards and registered in `governance/compat/CVF_ACTIVE_WINDOW_REGISTRY.json`
- architecture and baseline anchors explicitly marked permanent in script config

### Impact Screening

Before archive move, each candidate is scanned for reference impact:

- inbound references from active docs are counted
- the candidate is blocked if referenced by protected anchor files such as whitepaper, tracker, handoff, or index
- audit candidates explicitly listed in `governance/compat/CVF_AUDIT_RETENTION_REGISTRY.json` as retain-evidence stay active even when old
- dedicated active-window protection is evaluated before normal date-based archive eligibility
- the candidate is blocked if inbound active reference count exceeds threshold
- the candidate is blocked if active markdown links resolve directly to that file

### Baseline Rule

Archive cleanup MUST use the latest archive baseline as the default comparison point.

- `governance/compat/CVF_ACTIVE_ARCHIVE_BASELINE.json` is the canonical baseline written by the last successful archive sync
- default archive review modes (`--dry-run`, `--status`, `--impact-scan`) use incremental scope against that baseline
- if no baseline exists yet, the script performs a lightweight bootstrap snapshot and freezes the current active set as the initial comparison point without requiring a full-repository scan
- incremental scope re-checks:
  - files changed since the baseline
  - files newly old enough to become archive candidates
  - previously blocked candidates whose blocking sources changed
- full-repository archive screening is reserved for bootstrap, recovery, or explicit `--full-scan`

### Automation Required

Archive management is performed by running:

```bash
python scripts/cvf_active_archive.py --execute
```

To refresh the baseline without moving files:

```bash
python scripts/cvf_active_archive.py --refresh-baseline
```

This script should be run:

- before any major review or assessment session
- after completing a sprint or upgrade wave
- when safe-to-archive candidate count exceeds `10` files

### Hook Automation

Archive hygiene is no longer an optional manual reminder.

- local pre-commit and pre-push chains MUST run
  `governance/compat/check_active_archive_hygiene.py --max-stale 10 --fail-on-changed-stale --enforce`
- the hook-safe checker is fast and does not move files
- the checker treats baseline-blocked candidates as intentionally active and
  only fails on actionable backlog
- if the checker fails, run `python scripts/cvf_active_archive.py --execute`
  before continuing the commit/push
- `scripts/cvf_active_archive.py --status` must remain fast enough for routine
  operator use; if it times out, the archive guard implementation is broken

## Enforcement Surface

- active/archive maintenance runs through `scripts/cvf_active_archive.py`
- hook-safe stale-doc drift detection runs through `governance/compat/check_active_archive_hygiene.py`
- active-window classification and protected-set sync run through `governance/compat/check_active_window_registry.py`
- audit retention classification completeness runs through `governance/compat/check_audit_retention_registry.py`
- review retention classification completeness runs through `governance/compat/check_review_retention_registry.py`
- latest archive baseline is stored in `governance/compat/CVF_ACTIVE_ARCHIVE_BASELINE.json`
- governance drift exists when safe-to-archive files remain active without reason or when archive moves break references
- remediation requires running the archive script, verifying `CVF_ARCHIVE_INDEX.md`, and resolving `BROKEN-ARCHIVED` findings before more cleanup proceeds

## Final Clause

Archive hygiene is only useful when it preserves truth. CVF never archives first and asks questions later.
