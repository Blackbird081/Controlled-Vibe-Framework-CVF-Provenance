## Capability

Bridge CVF governance to **business operator workflows** — enabling non-technical users (Sales, Marketing, Ops, Finance, Strategy) to leverage AI agent capabilities with proper risk management, verification gates, and audit trails.

Key innovation: Apply CVF's "Controlled Autonomy" philosophy to business automation — not just developer tooling.

### The Operator Paradigm

**Who Is an Operator?**

| Role | Focus | CVF Value |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Head of Sales | Pipeline, forecasting, prospecting | Risk-assessed CRM automation |
| VP Marketing | Content, ad spend, distribution | Governed multi-channel workflows |
| Product Manager | Roadmap, tickets, status reports | Verified cross-tool synthesis |
| COO / Ops Lead | SOPs, incident analysis, scheduling | Context-managed document analysis |
| CFO / Finance | SEC filings, investment memos | Auditable financial analysis |
| CEO / Founder | Competitive landscape, strategy | Governed agent swarm research |

**Operator vs Developer Workflow**
```
Developer Path (existing CVF):
  Code → Test → Deploy → Monitor
  Tools: AGT-002 (Execute), AGT-026 (Testing), AGT-030 (Deploy)

Operator Path (AGT-034):
  Connect → Prompt → Verify → Act
  Tools: Connectors, Prompt Templates, Verification Gates, Output Validation
```

### Connector Architecture

**Connector Types & Risk Mapping**

| Connector Category | Examples | CVF Risk | Governance |
|-------------------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Read-Only Data** | CRM read, calendar view, ticket list | R1 | Auto — no side effects |
| **Data Synthesis** | Cross-tool reports, document analysis | R2 | Supervised — verify accuracy |
| **Write Actions** | Send email, create ticket, schedule meeting | R2 | Supervised — confirm before execute |
| **Financial Data** | SEC filings, spending reports, forecasts | R2 | Supervised — audit trail required |
| **Agent Swarms** | Parallel research, competitive analysis | R3 | Manual — review each agent output |

**Connector Security Checklist**
```
□ OAuth 2.0 authentication (never API keys in prompts)
□ Permission scoping (read-only by default)
□ Data residency compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
□ User-level access control (inherit business tool permissions)
□ Audit logging enabled for all connector actions
□ PII detection before outputting results
```

### 10 Governed Business Workflows

#### Category 1: Revenue Operations (Sales & Marketing)

**Workflow 1: Pipeline Risk Manager** — Risk: R2 (CRM data read + analysis). Connector: CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce). Governance: Read-only access, no deal modifications.
```
Prompt Template:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Access [CRM]. Retrieve all active deals assigned to me  │
│ with close date in current quarter.                     │
│                                                         │
│ 1. Create table: Deal Name, Amount, Stage, Last Activity│
│ 2. Flag any deal >$[threshold] with no activity >7 days │
│ 3. Generate forecast: likely to close vs. push to next Q│
│                                                         │

│ dashboard total. Report any discrepancy.                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
CVF Addition: Verification gate — always cross-reference AI output with source system totals.

**Workflow 2: Signal-Based Prospecting** — Risk: R2 (web research + email drafting). Connector: Agentic Search. Governance: No sending — draft only, human reviews before send.
```

### CVF Governance Overlay

**What CVF Adds to Every Operator Workflow**

| Principle | What It Means for Operators |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Risk Classification** | Every workflow has a risk level — know when you need supervision |
| **Verification Gates** | Don't trust output blindly — cross-check with source systems |
| **Evidence-Before-Claims** | AI must cite sources, not just assert facts |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Write actions (send email, schedule, modify data) always need human approval |
| **Escalation Rules** | Sensitive content (legal, financial, enterprise clients) auto-escalates |
| **Audit Trail** | Every workflow execution is logged for compliance |
| **Confidence Scoring** | Outputs marked as Verified / Inferred / Speculative |

**The Operator's Verification Checklist**
```
Before acting on any AI-generated business output:

□ DATA COMPLETENESS — Did AI process all expected records?
□ SUM CHECK — Do totals match source system dashboards?
□ SOURCE CITATION — Are specific records/URLs cited?
□ CONFIDENCE LEVEL — Is each claim marked with confidence?
□ BIAS CHECK — Could the AI be optimizing for what I want to hear?
□ FRESHNESS — Is the data current (check dates)?
□ ESCALATION — Does this output touch legal/financial/enterprise?
```

### Anti-Patterns — The "Auto-Pilot" Trap

| ❌ Anti-Pattern | ✅ CVF Approach |
|---------------|---------------|
| Let AI send emails directly | AI drafts, human reviews + sends |
| Trust pipeline forecast without checking | Verify deal count against CRM |
| Accept competitive analysis at face value | Review each agent's sources individually |
| Use AI financial analysis as-is | Mandatory disclaimers + independent verification |
| "It said it's done, so it's done" | AGT-031 Iron Law: no claims without fresh evidence |

### Integration with CVF Skills

| CVF Skill | How It Supports Operator Workflows |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| AGT-015: Workflow Hook | Automate pre/post-workflow triggers |
| AGT-018: Agent Teams | Orchestrate parallel research swarms |
| AGT-019: Progressive Loader | Load only needed workflow templates |
| AGT-021: Context Engineering | Optimize large document uploads (1M tokens) |
| AGT-031: Code Review Gate | Verification methodology applies to ALL outputs |
| AGT-033: AI Multimodal | Process uploaded charts, PDFs, presentations |

## Governance

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Risk Level | **R2 — Supervised** |
| Autonomy | Supervised — connects to external business systems, executes multi-step workflows |
| Roles | Orchestrator, Operator, Architect |
| Phase Gates | Discovery (workflow mapping), Design (prompt design), Build (connector integration), Review (output verification) |

Individual workflows within this skill range from R1 (read-only content transformation, Workflow 4) to R3 (multi-agent parallel research swarms, Workflow 10) per the Connector Types & Risk Mapping and per-workflow risk tags above; the skill's own baseline classification is R2 — Supervised.

---

## Risk Justification

- R2 baseline classification: connects to external business systems and executes multi-step workflows, requires supervision
- Write actions (send email, create ticket, schedule meeting) always require human confirmation before execute
- Agent swarm workflows (R3) require manual review of each agent's output before synthesis
- Financial data workflows require full audit trail and mandatory disclaimers
- Sensitive content (legal, financial, enterprise clients) auto-escalates per governance rules

---

## Constraints

- Write actions (send email, schedule, modify data) always need human approval — never auto-executed
- R3 (Agent Swarm) workflows require individual agent output review before synthesis
- Financial analysis outputs must include source citation, estimation flagging, and disclaimer
- Every workflow execution must be logged for compliance (audit trail)
- Sensitive content (legal/financial/enterprise) must auto-escalate, never proceed silently

---

## Dependencies

- **AGT-018** (Agent Team Orchestrator)
- **AGT-021** (Context Engineering Optimizer)
- **AGT-015** (Workflow Automation Hook)
- **AGT-031** (Code Review Gate) — verification methodology applies to ALL outputs
- **AGT-033** (AI Multimodal) — process uploaded charts, PDFs, presentations

---

## UAT Binding

**PASS criteria:**
- [ ] Every workflow execution logged for compliance (audit trail present)
- [ ] Write actions (send/schedule/modify) held for human approval before execution
- [ ] R3 swarm workflows show individual agent reports before synthesis
- [ ] Financial outputs include source citation and disclaimer
- [ ] Sensitive-content workflows (legal/financial/enterprise) escalate per rules

**FAIL criteria:**
- [ ] AI sends an email or executes a write action without human approval
- [ ] Agent swarm synthesis produced without individual agent review
- [ ] Financial analysis presented without disclaimer or source citation
- [ ] Workflow execution missing from audit log
- [ ] Enterprise-tier or legal/compliance content processed without escalation
